  Chapter 1

   ^1The ancestry of Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, who was
   descended from Abraham.

   ^2Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac of Jacob, and Jacob of
   Judah and his brothers,

   ^3and Judah of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. And Perez was
   the father of Hezron, and Hezron of Aram,

   ^4and Aram of Aminadab, and Aminadab of Nahshon, and Nahshon of Salmon,

   ^5and Salmon of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab. And Boaz was the father
   of Obed, whose mother was Ruth. And Obed was the father of Jesse,

   ^6and Jesse of King David.

   David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Uriah's wife.

   ^7And Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam of Abijah, and
   Abijah of Asa,

   ^8and Asa of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat of Joram, and Joram of
   Uzziah,

   ^9and Uzziah of Jotham, and Jotham of Ahaz, and Ahaz of Hezekiah,

   ^10and Hezekiah of Manasseh, and Manasseh of Amon, and Amon of Josiah,

   ^11and Josiah of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the period of the
   Babylonian Exile.

   ^12After the Babylonian Exile, Jeconiah had a son named Shealtiel, and
   Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel,

   ^13and Zerubbabel of Abiud, and Abiud of Eliakim, and Eliakim of Azor,

   ^14and Azor of Zadok, and Zadok of Achim, and Achim of Eliud,

   ^15and Eliud of Eleazar, and Eleazar of Matthan, and Matthan of Jacob,

   ^16and Jacob of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of
   Jesus called Christ.

   ^17So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is
   fourteen, and from David to the Babylonian Exile, fourteen, and from
   the Babylonian Exile to the Christ, fourteen.

   ^18Now these were the circumstances of the birth of Jesus Christ. Mary,
   his mother, was engaged to Joseph, but before they were married it was
   found that she was about to become a mother through the influence of
   the holy Spirit.

   ^19But her husband, Joseph, was an upright man and did not wish to
   disgrace her, and he decided to break off the engagement privately.

   ^20But while he was thinking of doing this, an angel of the Lord
   appeared to him in a dream, and said,

   "Joseph, descendant of David, do not fear to take Mary, your wife, to
   your home, for it is through the influence of the holy Spirit that she
   is to become a mother.

   ^21She will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for it is he who
   is to save his people from their sins."

   ^22All this happened in fulfilment of what the Lord said through the
   prophet,

   ^23"The maiden will be pregnant and will have a son,

   And they will name him Immanuel."

   --a word which means "God with us."

   ^24So when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord
   had directed him, and took his wife to his home.

   ^25But he did not live with her as a husband until she had had a son,
   and he named the child Jesus.

  Chapter 2

   ^1Now after the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the days of
   King Herod, astrologers from the east arrived at Jerusalem,

   ^2and asked,

   "Where is the newly born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star
   rise and we have come to do homage to him."

   ^3When King Herod heard of this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem
   with him.

   ^4So he called together all the high priests and scribes of the people
   and asked them where the Christ was to be born.

   ^5They said,

   "At Bethlehem in Judea, for this is what the prophet wrote:

   ^6" And you, Bethlehem in Judah's land,

   You are by no means least important among the leading places of Judah,

   For from you will come a leader

   Who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.' "

   ^7Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers, and found out from them
   the exact time when the star appeared.

   ^8And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said to them,

   "Go and inquire particularly about the child, and when you have found
   him, bring me word, so that I may go and do homage to him too."

   ^9So they obeyed the king and went, and the star which they had seen
   rise led them on until it reached the place where the child was, and
   stopped above it.

   ^10When they saw the star, they were very glad,

   ^11and they went into the house and saw the child with his mother,
   Mary, and they threw themselves down and did homage to him. They opened
   their treasure boxes and presented the child with gifts of gold,
   frankincense, and myrrh.

   ^12Then, as they had been divinely warned in a dream not to go back to
   Herod, they returned to their own country by another way.

   ^13When they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
   dream, and said,

   "Wake up! Take the child and his mother and make your escape to Egypt,
   and stay there until I tell you to leave. For Herod is going to look
   for the child in order to make away with him."

   ^14Then he awoke and took the child and his mother by night and took
   refuge in Egypt,

   ^15to fulfil what the Lord said by the prophet, "I called my son from
   Egypt."

   ^16Then Herod saw that he had been tricked by the astrologers, and he
   was very angry, and he sent and made away with all the boys in
   Bethlehem and in all that neighborhood who were two years old or under,
   for that was the tune he had learned from the astrologers by his
   inquiries.

   ^17Then the saying was fulfilled which was uttered by the prophet
   Jeremiah,

   ^18"A cry was heard in Ramah!

   Weeping and great lamenting!

   Rachel weeping for her children,

   And inconsolable because they were gone."

   ^19But when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to
   Joseph in Egypt

   ^20and said,

   "Wake up! Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel,
   for those who sought the child's life are dead."

   ^21Then he awoke, and took the child and his mother and went to the
   land of Israel.

   ^22But hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of
   his father, Herod, he was afraid to return there; and being warned in a
   dream, he took refuge in the region of Galilee,

   ^23and he went and settled in a town called Nazareth, in fulfilment of
   the saying of the prophets,

   "He shall be called a Nazarene."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1In those days John the Baptist appeared, and preached in the desert
   of Judea.

   ^2"Repent!" he said, "for the Kingdom of Heaven is coming!"

   ^3It was he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, when he said,

   "Hark! Someone is shouting in the desert,

   Get the Lord's way ready!

   Make his paths straight!' "

   ^4John wore clothing made of hair cloth, and he had a leather belt
   around his waist, and he lived on dried locusts and wild honey.

   ^5Then Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole Jordan valley went out to
   him,

   ^6and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, in acknowledgment
   of their sins.

   ^7But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for
   baptism, he said to them,

   "You brood of snakes! Who warned you to escape from the wrath that is
   coming?

   ^8Then produce fruit that will be consistent with your professed
   repentance!

   ^9Do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, We have Abraham for
   our forefather,' for I tell you God can produce descendants for Abraham
   right out of these stones!

   ^10But the axe is already lying at the roots of the trees. Any tree
   that fails to produce good fruit is going to be cut down and thrown
   into the fire.

   ^11I am baptizing you in water in token of your repentance, but he who
   is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not fit to carry his
   shoes. He will baptize you in the holy Spirit and in fire.

   ^12His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clean up his
   threshing-floor, and store his wheat in his barn, but he will burn up
   the chaff with inextinguishable fire."

   ^13Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized
   by him.

   ^14But John dissuaded him, and said,

   "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"

   ^15But Jesus answered,

   "Let it be so this time, for it is right for us to do everything that
   God requires."

   Then John consented.

   ^16And when Jesus was baptized, he went right up out of the water, and
   the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God come down like a dove
   and light upon him,

   ^17and a voice from heaven said,

   "This is my Son, my Beloved! This is my Chosen."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1Then Jesus was guided by the Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by
   the devil.

   ^2And he fasted forty days and nights, and after it he was famished.

   ^3And the tempter came up and said to him,

   "If you are God's son, tell these stones to turn into bread!"

   ^4But he answered,

   "The Scripture says, Not on bread alone is man to live, but on every
   word that comes from the mouth of God!' "

   ^5Then the devil took him to the holy city, and made him stand on the
   summit of the Temple,

   ^6and said to him,

   "If you are God's son, throw yourself down, for the Scripture says,

   " He will give his angels orders about you,

   And they will lift you up with their hands

   So that you may never strike your foot against a stone!' "

   ^7Jesus said to him,

   "The Scripture also says, You shall not try the Lord your God.' "

   ^8Again the devil took him to a very high mountain, and he showed him
   all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor,

   ^9and said to him,

   "I will give all this to you, if you will fall on your knees and do
   homage to me."

   ^10Then Jesus said to him,

   "Begone, Satan! For the Scripture says, You must do homage to the Lord
   your God, and worship him alone!' "

   ^11Then the devil left him, and angels came and waited on him.

   ^12But when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he retreated to
   Galilee.

   ^13And he left Nazareth and went and settled in Capernaum, by the sea,
   in the district of Zebulon and Naphtali,

   ^14in fulfilment of what was said by the prophet Isaiah,

   ^15"Zebulon's land, and Naphtali's land,

   Along the road to the sea, across the Jordan,

   Galilee of the nations!

   ^16The people that were living in darkness

   Have seen a great light,

   And on those who were living in the land of the shadow of death

   A light has dawned!"

   ^17From that time Jesus began to preach and say,

   "Repent! for the Kingdom of Heaven is coming!"

   ^18As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon,
   who was afterward called Peter, and his brother, Andrew, casting a net
   into the sea, for they were fishermen.

   ^19He said to them,

   "Come and follow me, and I will make you fish for men!"

   ^20They immediately dropped their nets and went with him.

   ^21And he went on a little farther and saw two other men who were
   brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother, John, in the boat
   with Zebedee, their father, putting their nets in order, and he called
   them.

   ^22And they immediately left the boat and their father, and went with
   him.

   ^23Then he went all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and
   proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing any disease or
   sickness among the people.

   ^24Word went all through Syria about him, and people brought to him all
   who were suffering with any kind of disease, or who were in great
   pain--demoniacs, epileptics, and paralytics--and he cured them.

   ^25Great crowds followed him about, from Galilee and the Ten Towns and
   Jerusalem and Judea and from the other side of the Jordan.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1When he saw the crowds of people he went up on the mountain. There he
   seated himself, and when his disciples had come up to him,

   ^2he opened his lips to teach them. And he said,

   ^3"Blessed are those who feel their spiritual need, for the Kingdom of
   Heaven belongs to them!

   ^4"Blessed are the mourners, for they will be consoled!

   ^5"Blessed are the humble-minded, for they will possess the land!

   ^6"Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for uprightness, for
   they will be satisfied!

   ^7"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy!

   ^8"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God!

   ^9"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called God's sons!

   ^10"Blessed are those who have endured persecution for their
   uprightness, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them!

   ^11"Blessed are you when people abuse you, and persecute you, and
   falsely say everything bad of you, on my account.

   ^12Be glad and exult over it, for you will be richly rewarded in
   heaven, for that is the way they persecuted the prophets who went
   before you!

   ^13"You are the salt of the earth! But if salt loses its strength, how
   can it be made salt again? It is good for nothing but to be thrown away
   and trodden underfoot.

   ^14You are the light of the world! A city that is built upon a hill
   cannot be hidden.

   ^15People do not light a lamp and put it under a peck-measure; they put
   it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.

   ^16Your light must burn in that way among men so that they will see the
   good you do, and praise your Father in heaven.

   ^17"Do not suppose that I have come to do away with the Law or the
   Prophets. I have not come to do away with them but to enforce them.

   ^18For I tell you, as long as heaven and earth endure, not one dotting
   of an i or crossing of a t will be dropped from the Law until it is all
   observed.

   ^19Anyone, therefore, who weakens one of the slightest of these
   commands, and teaches others to do so, will be ranked lowest in the
   Kingdom of Heaven; but anyone who observes them and teaches others to
   do so will be ranked high in the Kingdom of Heaven.

   ^20For I tell you that unless your uprightness is far superior to that
   of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never even enter the Kingdom of
   Heaven!

   ^21"You have heard that the men of old were told You shall not murder,'
   and Whoever murders will have to answer to the court.'

   ^22But I tell you that anyone who gets angry with his brother will have
   to answer to the court, and anyone who speaks contemptuously to his
   brother will have to answer to the great council, and anyone who says
   to his brother You cursed fool!' will have to answer for it in the
   fiery pit!

   ^23So when you are presenting your gift at the altar, if you remember
   that your brother has any grievance against you,

   ^24leave your gift right there before the altar and go and make up with
   your brother; then come back and present your gift.

   ^25Be quick and come to terms with your opponent while you are on the
   way to court with him, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the
   judge may hand you over to the officer, and you will be thrown into
   prison.

   ^26I tell you, you will never get out again until you have paid the
   last penny!

   ^27"You have heard that men were told You shall not commit adultery.'

   ^28But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman with desire has
   already committed adultery with her in his heart.

   ^29But if your right eye makes you fall, tear it out and throw it away,
   for you might better lose one part of your body than have it all thrown
   into the pit!

   ^30If your right hand makes you fall, cut it off and throw it away, for
   you might better lose one part of your body than have it all go down to
   the pit!

   ^31"They were told, Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a
   certificate of divorce.'

   ^32But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife on any ground,
   except unfaithfulness, makes her commit adultery, and anyone who
   marries her after she is divorced commits adultery.

   ^33"Again, you have heard that the men of old were told, You shall not
   swear falsely, but you must fulfil your oaths to the Lord.'

   ^34But I tell you not to swear at all, either by heaven, for it is
   God's throne,

   ^35or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is
   the city of the great king.

   ^36You must not swear by your own head, for you cannot make one single
   hair white or black.

   ^37But your way of speaking must be Yes' or No.' Anything that goes
   beyond that comes from the evil one.

   ^38"You have heard that they were told, An eye for an eye and a tooth
   for a tooth.'

   ^39But I tell you not to resist injury, but if anyone strikes you on
   your right cheek, turn the other to him too;

   ^40and if anyone wants to sue you for your shirt, let him have your
   coat too.

   ^41And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go two miles with him.

   ^42If anyone begs from you, give to him, and when anyone wants to
   borrow from you, do not turn away.

   ^43"You have heard that they were told, You must love your neighbor and
   hate your enemy.'

   ^44But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for your persecutors,

   ^45so that you may show yourselves true sons of your Father in heaven,
   for he makes his sun rise on bad and good alike, and makes the rain
   fall on the upright and the wrongdoers.

   ^46For if you love only those who love you, what reward can you expect?
   Do not the very tax-collectors do that?

   ^47And if you are polite to your brothers and no one else, what is
   there remarkable in that? Do not the very heathen do that?

   ^48So you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1"But take care not to do your good deeds in public for people to see,
   for, if you do, you will get no reward from your Father in heaven.

   ^2So when you are going to give to charity, do not blow a trumpet
   before yourself, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and the
   streets, to make people praise them. I tell you, that is all the reward
   they will get!

   ^3But when you give to charity, your own left hand must not know what
   your right hand is doing,

   ^4so that your charity may be secret, and your Father who sees what is
   secret will reward you.

   ^5"When you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, for they like to
   pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the squares, to
   let people see them. I tell you, that is the only reward they will get!

   ^6But when you pray, go into your own room, and shut the door, and pray
   to your Father who is unseen, and your Father who sees what is secret
   will reward you.

   ^7And when you pray, do not repeat empty phrases as the heathen do, for
   they imagine that their prayers will be heard if they use words enough.

   ^8You must not be like them. For God, who is your Father, knows what
   you need before you ask him.

   ^9This, therefore, is the way you are to pray:

   Our Father in heaven,

   Your name be revered!

   ^10Your kingdom come!

   Your will be done on earth as it is done in heaven!

   ^11Give us today bread for the day,

   ^12And forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven our debtors.

   ^13And do not subject us to temptation,

   But save us from the evil one.'

   ^14For if you forgive others when they offend you, your heavenly Father
   will forgive you too.

   ^15But if you do not forgive others when they offend you, your heavenly
   Father will not forgive you for your offenses.

   ^16"When you fast, do not put on a gloomy look, like the hypocrites,
   for they neglect their personal appearance to let people see that they
   are fasting. I tell you, that is all the reward they will get.

   ^17But when you fast, perfume your hair and wash your face,

   ^18so that no one may see that you are fasting, except your Father who
   is unseen, and your Father who sees what is secret, will reward you.

   ^19"Do not store up your riches on earth, where moths and rust destroy
   them, and where thieves break in and steal them,

   ^20but store up your riches in heaven, where moths and rust cannot
   destroy them, and where thieves cannot break in and steal them.

   ^21For wherever your treasure is, your heart will be also.

   ^22The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your eye is sound, your
   whole body will be light,

   ^23but if your eye is unsound, your whole body will be dark. If,
   therefore, your very light is darkness, how deep the darkness will be!

   ^24No slave can belong to two masters, for he will either hate one and
   love the other, or stand by one and make light of the other. You cannot
   serve God and money.

   ^25Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about life, wondering what you
   will have to eat or drink, or about your body, wondering what you will
   have to wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body than
   clothes?

   ^26Look at the wild birds. They do not sow or reap, or store their food
   in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more
   account than they?

   ^27But which of you with all his worry can add a single hour to his
   life?

   ^28Why should you worry about clothing? See how the wild flowers grow.
   They do not toil or spin,

   ^29and yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his splendor was never
   dressed like one of them.

   ^30But if God so beautifully dresses the wild grass, which is alive
   today and is thrown into the furnace tomorrow, will he not much more
   surely clothe you, you who have so little faith?

   ^31So do not worry and say, What shall we have to eat?' or What shall
   we have to drink?' or What shall we have to wear?'

   ^32For these are all things the heathen are in pursuit of, and your
   heavenly Father knows well that you need all this.

   ^33But you must make his kingdom, and uprightness before him, your
   greatest care, and you will have all these other things besides.

   ^34So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will have worries of
   its own. Let each day be content with its own ills.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1"Pass no more judgments upon other people, so that you may not have
   judgment passed upon you.

   ^2For you will be judged by the standard you judge by, and men will pay
   you back with the same measure you have used with them.

   ^3Why do you keep looking at the speck in your brother's eye, and pay
   no attention to the beam that is in your own?

   ^4How can you say to your brother, Just let me get that speck out of
   your eye,' when all the time there is a beam in your own?

   ^5You hypocrite! First get the beam out of your own eye, and then you
   can see to get the speck out of your brother's eye.

   ^6"Do not give what is sacred to dogs, and do not throw your pearls
   before pigs, or they will trample them under their feet and turn and
   tear you in pieces.

   ^7Ask, and what you ask will be given you. Search, and you will find
   what you search for. Knock, and the door will open to you.

   ^8For it is always the one who asks who receives, and the one who
   searches who finds, and the one who knocks to whom the door opens.

   ^9Which of you men when his son asks him for some bread will give him a
   stone?

   ^10Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake?

   ^11So if you, bad as you are, know enough to give your children what is
   good, how much more surely will your Father in heaven give what is good
   to those who ask him for it!

   ^12Therefore, you must always treat other people as you would like to
   have them treat you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

   ^13"Go in at the narrow gate. For the road that leads to destruction is
   broad and spacious, and there are many who go in by it.

   ^14But the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life, and
   there are few that find it.

   ^15"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you disguised as sheep
   but are ravenous wolves underneath.

   ^16You can tell them by their fruit. Do people pick grapes off thorns,
   or figs off thistles?

   ^17Just so any sound tree bears good fruit, but a poor tree bears bad
   fruit.

   ^18No sound tree can bear bad fruit, and no poor tree can bear good
   fruit.

   ^19Any tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and burned.

   ^20So you can tell them by their fruit.

   ^21It is not everyone who says to me Lord! Lord!' who will get into the
   Kingdom of Heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in
   heaven.

   ^22Many will say to me on that Day, Lord! Lord! Was it not in your name
   that we prophesied, and by your name that we drove out demons, and by
   your name that we did many mighty acts?'

   ^23Then I will say to them plainly, I never knew you! Go away from me,
   you who do wrong!'

   ^24"Everyone, therefore, who listens to this teaching of mine and acts
   upon it, will be like a sensible man who built his house on rock.

   ^25And the rain fell, and the rivers rose, and the winds blew, and beat
   about that house, and it did not go down, for its foundations were on
   rock.

   ^26And anyone who listens to this teaching of mine and does not act
   upon it, will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand.

   ^27And the rain fell, and the rivers rose, and the winds blew and beat
   about that house, and it went down, and its downfall was complete."

   ^28When Jesus had finished this discourse, the crowds were astounded at
   his teaching,

   ^29for he taught them like one who had authority and not like their
   scribes.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1When Jesus came down from the mountain, great crowds of people
   followed him.

   ^2And a leper came up to him and fell on his knees before him, saying,

   "If you only choose, sir, you can cure me!"

   ^3So he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying,

   "I do choose! Be cured!"

   And his leprosy was immediately cured.

   ^4Then Jesus said to him,

   "See that you tell nobody, but go! Show yourself to the priest, and in
   proof of your cure, offer the gift that Moses prescribed."

   ^5When he got back to Capernaum, a Roman captain came up and appealed
   to him,

   ^6saying,

   "My servant, sir, is lying sick with paralysis at my house, in great
   distress."

   ^7He said to him,

   "I will come and cure him."

   ^8But the captain answered,

   "I am not a suitable person, sir, to have you come under my roof, but
   simply say the word, and my servant will be cured.

   ^9For I am myself under the orders of others and I have soldiers under
   me, and I tell one to go, and he goes, and another to come, and he
   comes, and my slave to do something, and he does it."

   ^10When Jesus heard this he was astonished, and said to his followers,

   "I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such faith as this.

   ^11And I tell you, many will come from the east and from the west and
   take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the
   Kingdom of Heaven,

   ^12while the heirs to the kingdom will be driven into the darkness
   outside, there to weep and grind their teeth!"

   ^13Then Jesus said to the captain,

   "Go! You shall find it just as you believe!"

   And the servant was immediately cured.

   ^14Jesus went into Peter's house, and there he found Peter's
   mother-in-law sick in bed with fever.

   ^15And he touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and
   waited on him.

   ^16In the evening they brought to him many who were possessed by
   demons, and he drove the spirits out with a word, and cured all who
   were sick,

   ^17in fulfilment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, "He took our
   sickness and carried away our diseases."

   ^18Then Jesus, seeing a crowd about him, gave orders to cross to the
   other side.

   ^19And a scribe came up and said to him,

   "Master, I will follow you wherever you are going!"

   ^20And Jesus said to him,

   "Foxes have holes and wild birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no
   where to lay his head!"

   ^21And another of his disciples said to him,

   "Let me first go, sir, and bury my father."

   ^22But Jesus said to him,

   "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead!"

   ^23And he got into the boat, and his disciples went with him.

   ^24And suddenly a terrific storm came up on the sea, so that the waves
   broke over the boat, but he remained asleep.

   ^25And they came and woke him up, saying,

   "Save us, sir! We are lost!"

   ^26And he said to them,

   "Why are you afraid? You have so little faith!"

   Then he got up and reproved the wind and the sea, and there was a great
   calm.

   ^27And the men were amazed and said,

   "What kind of man is this? For the very winds and sea obey him!"

   ^28When he reached the other side, in the region of Gadara, two men
   possessed by demons came out of the tombs and confronted him; they were
   so extremely violent that nobody could go along that road.

   ^29And they suddenly screamed out,

   "What do you want of us, you Son of God? Have you come here before the
   appointed time to torture us?"

   ^30Now at some distance from them there was a great drove of pigs
   feeding.

   ^31And the demons entreated him, saying,

   "If you are going to drive us out, send us into the drove of pigs."

   ^32And he said to them,

   "Begone!"

   And they came out and went into the pigs. And suddenly the whole drove
   rushed over the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the water.

   ^33And the men who tended them ran away and went off to the town and
   told it all, and the news about the men possessed by demons.

   ^34And the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him
   they begged him to go away from their district.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   ^1So he got into the boat and crossed the sea, and returned to his own
   city.

   ^2Some people came bringing to him on a bed a man who was paralyzed.
   Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man,

   "Courage, my son! Your sins are forgiven."

   ^3Some of the scribes said to themselves,

   "This man is talking blasphemy!"

   ^4Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said,

   "Why do you have such wicked thoughts in your hearts?

   ^5For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, Get
   up and walk'?

   ^6But I would have you know that the Son of Man has authority to
   forgive sins on earth." Then he said to the paralytic,

   "Get up, pick up your bed and go home!"

   ^7And he got up and went home.

   ^8And when the crowd saw it, they were filled with awe, and praised God
   for giving such power to men.

   ^9Afterward, as Jesus was passing along, he saw a man called Matthew
   sitting at the tollhouse, and he said to him,

   "Follow me!"

   And he got up and followed him.

   ^10While Jesus was at home at table, a number of tax-collectors and
   irreligious people came in and joined Jesus and his disciples at table.

   ^11And the Pharisees observed it, and they said to his disciples,

   "Why does your master eat with tax-collectors and irreligious people?"

   ^12But he heard it, and said,

   "It is not well people but the sick who have to have the doctor!

   ^13You must go and learn what the saying means, It is mercy, not
   sacrifice, that I care for.' I did not come to invite the pious but the
   irreligious."

   ^14Then the disciples of John came up to him and said,

   "Why is it that we and the Pharisees are keeping the fast, while your
   disciples are not keeping it?"

   ^15Jesus said to them,

   "Can wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But a
   time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and they
   will fast then.

   ^16But no one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old coat, for the
   patch will tear away from the coat, and make the hole worse than ever.

   ^17And people do not put new wine into old wine-skins, or if they do,
   the skins burst, and the wine runs out and the skins are spoiled. But
   people put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and so both are saved."

   ^18Just as he said this to them, an official came up and bowing low
   before him said to him,

   "My daughter has just died. But come! Lay your hand on her and she will
   come to life!"

   ^19And Jesus got up and followed him, with his disciples.

   ^20And a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind
   him and touched the tassel of his cloak.

   ^21For she said to herself, "If I can just touch his cloak, I will get
   well."

   ^22And Jesus turned and saw her, and he said,

   "Courage, my daughter! Your faith has cured you!" And from that time
   the woman was well.

   ^23When Jesus reached the official's house, and saw the flute-players
   and the disturbance the crowd was making,

   ^24he said,

   "You must go away, for the girl is not dead; she is asleep." And they
   laughed at him.

   ^25But when he had driven the people out, he went in and grasped her
   hand, and the girl got up.

   ^26And the news of this spread all over that part of the country.

   ^27As Jesus was passing along from there, two blind men followed him,
   calling out,

   "Take pity on us, you Son of David!"

   ^28When he had gone indoors, the blind men came up to him, and he said
   to them,

   "Do you believe that I can do this?" They said to him,

   "Yes, sir."

   ^29Then he touched their eyes and said,

   "You shall have what your faith expects."

   ^30And their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly not to let
   anyone hear of it.

   ^31But they went out and spread the news about him all over that part
   of the country.

   ^32But just as they were going out, some people brought to him a dumb
   man who was possessed by a demon,

   ^33and as soon as the demon was driven out, the dumb man was able to
   speak. And the crowds were amazed, and said,

   "Nothing like this was ever seen in Israel!"

   ^34But the Pharisees said,

   "It is by the aid of the prince of the demons that he drives them out."

   ^35Jesus went round among all the towns and villages, teaching in their
   synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing
   any disease or illness.

   ^36But the sight of the crowds of people filled him with pity for them,
   because they were bewildered and dejected, like sheep that have no
   shepherd.

   ^37Then he said to his disciples,

   "The harvest is abundant enough, but the reapers are few.

   ^38So pray to the owner of the harvest to send reapers to gather it."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1Then he called his twelve disciples to him, and gave them power over
   the foul spirits so that they could drive them out, and so that they
   could heal any disease or illness.

   ^2These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who was
   called Peter, and his brother Andrew, and James the son of Zebedee and
   his brother John,

   ^3Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax-collector, James
   the son of Alpheus and Thaddeus,

   ^4Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot who afterward betrayed him.

   ^5Jesus sent these twelve out, after giving them these directions:

   "Do not go among the heathen, or to any Samaritan town,

   ^6but proceed instead to the lost sheep of Israel's house.

   ^7And as you go about, preach and say, The Kingdom of Heaven is at
   hand!'

   ^8Cure the sick, raise the dead, heal lepers, drive out demons. Give
   without payment, just as you received without payment.

   ^9Do not accept gold or silver or copper money to put in your pockets,

   ^10and do not take a bag for your journey, nor two shirts, nor shoes,
   nor a staff, for the workman deserves his food!

   ^11Whatever town or village you come to, inquire for some suitable
   person, and stay with him till you leave the place.

   ^12And as you go into his house, wish it well.

   ^13If the house deserves it, the peace you wish it will come over it,
   but if it does not deserve it, your blessing will come back upon
   yourselves.

   ^14And where no one will welcome you, or listen to you, leave that
   house or town and shake off its very dust from your feet.

   ^15I tell you, the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will fare better on the
   Day of Judgment than that town.

   ^16"Here I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So you must be
   wise like serpents, and guileless like doves.

   ^17But be on your guard against men, for they will give you up to their
   courts, and have you flogged in their synagogues,

   ^18and you will be brought before governors and kings on my account, to
   bear your testimony before them and the heathen.

   ^19But when they give you up, you must have no anxiety about how to
   speak or what to say, for you will be told at the very moment what you
   ought to say,

   ^20for it is not you who will speak, it is the Spirit of your Father
   that will speak through you.

   ^21One brother will give up another to death, and a father his child,
   and children will turn against their parents, and have them put to
   death.

   ^22You will be hated by everybody on my account, but the man who holds
   out to the very end will be saved.

   ^23But when they persecute you in one town, make your escape to
   another, for I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns
   of Israel before the Son of Man arrives.

   ^24A pupil is not better than his teacher, nor a slave better than his
   master.

   ^25A pupil should be satisfied to come to be like his teacher, or a
   slave, to come to be like his master. If men have called the head of
   the house Beelzebub, how much worse names will they give to the members
   of his household!

   ^26So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing covered up that is
   not going to be uncovered, nor secret that is not going to be known.

   ^27What I tell you in the dark you must say in the light, and what you
   hear whispered in your ear, you must proclaim from the housetops.

   ^28Have no fear of those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul.
   You had better be afraid of one who can destroy both soul and body in
   the pit.

   ^29Do not sparrows sell two for a cent? And yet not one of them can
   fall to the ground against your Father's will!

   ^30But the very hairs on your heads are all counted.

   ^31You must not be afraid; you are worth more than a great many
   sparrows!

   ^32Therefore everyone who will acknowledge me before men I will
   acknowledge before my Father in heaven,

   ^33but anyone who disowns me before men, I will disown before my Father
   in heaven.

   ^34"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have
   not come to bring peace but a sword.

   ^35For I have come to turn a man against his father and a daughter
   against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,

   ^36and a man's enemies will be in his own household.

   ^37No one who loves father or mother more than he loves me is worthy of
   me, and no one who loves son or daughter more than he loves me is
   worthy of me,

   ^38and no one who will not take up his cross and follow me is worthy of
   me.

   ^39Whoever gains his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for
   my sake will gain it.

   ^40"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes
   him who has sent me.

   ^41Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will have the
   same reward as a prophet, and whoever welcomes an upright man because
   he is upright will have the same reward as an upright man.

   ^42And no one who will give the humblest of my disciples even a cup of
   cold water because he is my disciple, I tell you, can ever fail of his
   reward."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1When Jesus had finished giving his twelve disciples these
   instructions, he went on from there to teach and preach in their towns.

   ^2Now when John heard in prison of what the Christ was doing, he sent
   by his disciples

   ^3and said to him,

   "Are you the one who was to come, or should we look for someone else?"

   ^4Jesus answered,

   "Go and report to John what you hear and see.

   ^5The blind are regaining their sight and the lame can walk, the lepers
   are being cured and the deaf can hear, the dead are being raised and
   good news is being preached to the poor.

   ^6And blessed is the man who finds nothing that repels him in me."

   ^7But as they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about
   John.

   "What was it that you went out into the desert to look at? A reed
   swaying in the wind?

   ^8Then what did you go out there to see? A man luxuriously dressed? Men
   who dress in that way you find in the palaces of kings.

   ^9Then why did you go out there? Was it to see a prophet? Yes, I tell
   you, and far more than a prophet!

   ^10This is the man of whom the Scripture says,

   " Here I send my messenger on before you;

   He will prepare the road ahead of you.'

   ^11"I tell you, among men born of women no one greater than John the
   Baptist has ever appeared. And yet those who are of little importance
   in the Kingdom of Heaven are greater than he.

   ^12But from the time of John the Baptist until now men have been taking
   the Kingdom of Heaven by storm and impetuously crowding into it.

   ^13For up to the time of John all the Prophets and the Law itself
   prophesied about it,

   ^14and, if you are ready to accept the idea, he is himself Elijah who
   was to come.

   ^15Let him who has ears listen!

   ^16But to what can I compare this present age? It is like children
   sitting about in the bazaars and calling out to their playmates,

   ^17" We have played the flute for you, and you would not dance!

   We have wailed and you would not beat your breasts!'

   ^18For when John came, he neither ate nor drank, and people said, He
   has a demon!'

   ^19Now that the Son of Man has come, he does eat and drink, and people
   say, Look at him! A glutton and a drinker, the companion of
   tax-collectors and irreligious people!' And yet Wisdom is vindicated by
   her actions!"

   ^20Then he began to reproach the towns in which his numerous wonders
   had been done, because they did not repent.

   ^21"Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if the wonders
   that have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would
   have repented in sackcloth and ashes long ago!

   ^22But I tell you, Tyre and Sidon will fare better on the Day of
   Judgment than you will!

   ^23And you, Capernaum! Are you to be exalted to the skies? You will go
   down among the dead! For if the wonders that have been done in you had
   been done in Sodom, it would have stood until today.

   ^24But I tell you that the land of Sodom will fare better on the Day of
   Judgment than you will!"

   ^25At that same time Jesus said,

   "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding all this
   from the learned and intelligent and revealing it to children.

   ^26Yes, I thank you, Father, for choosing to have it so.

   ^27Everything has been handed over to me by my Father, and no one
   understands the Son but the Father, nor does anyone understand the
   Father but the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

   ^28Come to me, all of you who toil and are burdened, and I will let you
   rest.

   ^29Let my yoke be put upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and
   humble-minded, and your hearts will find rest,

   ^30for the yoke I offer you is a kindly one, and the load I ask you to
   bear is light."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1At that same time Jesus walked one Sabbath through the wheat fields,
   and his disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of wheat
   and eat them.

   ^2But the Pharisees saw it and said to him,

   "Look! Your disciples are doing something which it is against the Law
   to do on the Sabbath!"

   ^3But he said to them,

   "Did you never read what David did, when he and his companions were
   hungry?

   ^4How is it that he went into the House of God and that they ate the
   Presentation Loaves which it was against the Law for him and his
   companions to eat, or for anyone except the priests?

   ^5Or did you never read in the Law how the priests in the Temple are
   not guilty when they break the Sabbath?

   ^6But I tell you, there is something greater than the Temple here!

   ^7But if you knew what the saying means, It is mercy, not sacrifice,
   that I care for,' you would not have condemned men who are not guilty.

   ^8For the Son of Man is master of the Sabbath."

   ^9And he left the place and went into their synagogue.

   ^10There was a man there with one hand withered. And in order to get a
   charge to bring against him, they asked him,

   "Is it right to cure people on the Sabbath?"

   ^11But he said to them,

   "Who among you if he has even a single sheep and it falls into a hole
   on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?

   ^12And how much more a man is worth than a sheep! Therefore, it is
   right to do people good on the Sabbath."

   ^13Then he said to the man,

   "Hold out your hand!"

   And he held it out, and it was restored and became as well as the
   other.

   ^14But the Pharisees left the synagogue and consulted about him, with a
   view to putting him to death.

   ^15But Jesus knew of this, and he left that place. And numbers of
   people followed him about, and he cured them all,

   ^16and warned them not to say anything about him

   ^17--in fulfilment of what was said by the prophet Isaiah,

   ^18"Here is my servant whom I have selected,

   My beloved, who delights my heart!

   I will endow him with my Spirit,

   And he will announce a judgment to the heathen.

   ^19He will not wrangle or make an outcry,

   And no one will hear his voice in the streets;

   ^20He will not break off a bent reed,

   And he will not put out a smoldering wick,

   Until he carries his judgment to success.

   ^21The heathen will rest their hopes on his name!"

   ^22At that time some people brought to him a man blind and dumb, who
   was possessed by a demon, and he cured him, so that the dumb man could
   speak and see.

   ^23And all the crowds of people were astounded, and said,

   "Can this be the Son of David?"

   ^24But when the Pharisees heard of it they said,

   "This man cannot drive out demons except by the aid of Beelzebub, the
   prince of the demons."

   ^25But he knew what they were thinking, and he said to them,

   "Any kingdom that is disunited is on the way to destruction, and any
   city or household that is disunited cannot last.

   ^26If Satan is driving Satan out, he is disunited, and so how can his
   kingdom last?

   ^27And if I am driving the demons out by Beelzebub's aid, by whose aid
   do your sons drive them out? Therefore let them be your judges.

   ^28But if I am driving the demons out by the aid of God's Spirit, then
   the Kingdom of God has overtaken you.

   ^29How can anyone get into a strong man's house and carry off his
   property unless he first binds the strong man? After that he can
   plunder his house.

   ^30Anyone who is not with me is against me, and anyone who does not
   join me in gathering, scatters.

   ^31Therefore, I tell you, men will be forgiven for any sin or abusive
   speech, but abusive speech about the Spirit cannot be forgiven.

   ^32And whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven for it,
   but whoever speaks against the holy Spirit cannot be forgiven for it,
   either in this world or in the world to come.

   ^33"You must either make the tree sound and its fruit sound, or make
   the tree bad and its fruit bad; a tree is judged by its fruit.

   ^34You brood of snakes! how can you, bad as you are, utter anything
   good? For the mouth says only what the heart is full of.

   ^35A good man, out of the good he has accumulated, brings out things
   that are good, and a bad man, out of what he has accumulated that is
   bad, brings out things that are bad.

   ^36But I tell you, for every careless word that men utter they will
   have to answer on the Day of Judgment.

   ^37For it is by your words that you will be acquitted, or by your words
   that you will be condemned."

   ^38Then some of the scribes and Pharisees addressed him, saying,

   "Master, we would like to have you show us some sign."

   ^39But he answered,

   "Only a wicked and faithless age insists upon a sign, and no sign will
   be given it but the sign of the prophet Jonah.

   ^40For just as Jonah was in the maw of the whale for three days and
   nights, the Son of Man will be three days and nights in the heart of
   the earth.

   ^41Men of Nineveh will rise with this age at the judgment and condemn
   it, for when Jonah preached they repented, and there is more than Jonah
   here!

   ^42The queen of the south will rise with this age at the judgment and
   condemn it, for she came from the very ends of the earth to listen to
   Solomon's wisdom, and there is more than Solomon here!

   ^43"When a foul spirit goes out of a man, it roams through deserts in
   search of rest and can find none.

   ^44Then it says, I will go back to my house that I left,' and it goes
   and finds it unoccupied, cleaned, and all in order.

   ^45Then it goes and gets seven other spirits more wicked than itself,
   and they go in and live there, and in the end the man is worse off than
   he was before. That is the way it will be with this present wicked
   age."

   ^46While he was still speaking, his mother and his brothers came up and
   stood outside the crowd, wanting to speak to him.

   ^48But he said to the man who told him,

   "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"

   ^49And he pointed to his disciples and said,

   "Here are my mother and my brothers!

   ^50For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and
   sister and mother!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   ^1That same day Jesus went out of his house and was sitting on the
   seashore.

   ^2And such great crowds gathered about him that he got into a boat and
   sat down in it, while all the people stood on the shore.

   ^3And he told them many things in figures, and said to them,

   "A sower went out to sow,

   ^4and as he was sowing, some of the seed fell by the path and the birds
   came and ate it up,

   ^5and some fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil and it
   sprang up at once, because the soil was not deep,

   ^6but when the sun came up it was scorched and withered up, because it
   had no root.

   ^7And some of it fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and
   choked it out.

   ^8And some fell on good soil, and yielded some a hundred, some sixty,
   and some thirty-fold.

   ^9Let him who has ears listen!"

   ^10His disciples came up and said to him,

   "Why do you speak to them in figures?"

   ^11He answered,

   "You are permitted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but
   they are not.

   ^12For people who have will have more given to them, and will be
   plentifully supplied, and from people who have nothing even what they
   have will be taken away.

   ^13This is why I speak to them in figures, because though they look
   they do not see, and though they listen they do not hear or understand.

   ^14They are a fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy,

   " You will listen and listen, and never understand,

   And you will look and look, and never see!

   ^15For this nation's mind has grown dull,

   And they hear faintly with their ears,

   And they have shut their eyes,

   So as never to see with their eyes,

   And hear with their ears,

   And understand with their minds, and turn back,

   And let me cure them!'

   ^16But blessed are your eyes, for they do see, and your ears, for they
   do hear.

   ^17For I tell you, many prophets and upright men have longed to see
   what you see, and could not see it, and to hear what you hear, and
   could not hear it.

   ^18"You must listen closely then to the figure of the sower.

   ^19When anyone hears the teaching of the kingdom and does not
   understand it, the evil one comes and robs him of the seed that has
   been sown in his mind. That is what was sown along the path.

   ^20And what was sown upon the rocky soil means the man who hears the
   message and at once accepts it joyfully,

   ^21but it takes no real root in him, and lasts only a little while, and
   when trouble or persecution comes because of the message, he gives it
   up at once.

   ^22And what was sown among the thorns means the man who listens to the
   message, and then the worries of the time and the pleasure of being
   rich choke the message out, and it yields nothing.

   ^23And what was sown in good ground means the man who listens to the
   message and understands it, and yields one a hundred, and another
   sixty, and another thirty-fold."

   ^24Another figure which he used in speaking to them was this:

   "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,

   ^25but while people were asleep his enemy came and sowed weeds among
   the wheat, and went away.

   ^26And when the wheat came up and ripened, the weeds appeared too.

   ^27And the owner's slaves came to him and said, Was not the seed good
   that you sowed in your field, sir? So where did these weeds come from?'

   ^28He said to them, This is some enemy's doing.' And they said to him,
   Do you want us to go and gather them up?'

   ^29But he said, No, for in gathering up the weeds you may uproot the
   wheat.

   ^30Let them both grow together until harvest time, and when we harvest
   I will direct the reapers to gather up the weeds first and tie them up
   in bundles to burn, but get the wheat into my barn.' "

   ^31Another figure which he used in speaking to them was this:

   "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and
   sowed in his field.

   ^32It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the
   largest of plants and grows into a tree, so that the wild birds come
   and roost in its branches."

   ^33Another figure which he used with them was this:

   "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took and buried in
   a bushel of flour until it had all risen."

   ^34Jesus said all this to the crowds in figures, and told them nothing
   except in figures,

   ^35to fulfil what was said by the prophet,

   "I will open my mouth in figures,

   I will utter things that have been hidden since the creation."

   ^36Then he left the crowds and went into his house. And his disciples
   came up to him and said,

   "Explain to us the figure of the weeds in the field."

   ^37He answered,

   "The sower who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.

   ^38The field is the world. The good seed is the people of the kingdom.
   The weeds are the wicked.

   ^39The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the close of
   the age, and the reapers are angels.

   ^40So just as the weeds are gathered up and burned, this is what will
   happen at the close of the age;

   ^41the Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather up out
   of his kingdom all the causes of sin and the wrongdoers

   ^42and throw them into the blazing furnace; there they will wail and
   grind their teeth.

   ^43Then the upright will shine out like the sun, in their Father's
   kingdom. Let him who has ears listen!

   ^44"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a hoard of money, buried in a field,
   which a man found, and buried again. And he was overjoyed, and went and
   sold everything he had and bought the field.

   ^45"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dealer in search of fine
   pearls.

   ^46He found one costly pearl, and went and sold everything he had, and
   bought it.

   ^47"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was let down into
   the sea, and inclosed fish of all kinds.

   ^48When it was full, they dragged it up on the beach, and sat down and
   sorted the good fish into baskets and threw the bad away.

   ^49That is what will happen at the close of the age. The angels will go
   out and remove the wicked from among the upright,

   ^50and throw them into the blazing furnace. There they will wail and
   grind their teeth.

   ^51"Do you understand all this?" They said to him,

   "Yes."

   ^52He said to them,

   "Then remember that every scribe who has become a disciple of the
   Kingdom of Heaven must be like a householder who can supply from his
   storeroom new things as well as old."

   ^53When Jesus had finished these figures, he left that place,

   ^54and went to his own part of the country. And he taught the people in
   their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished, and said,

   "Where did he get this wisdom, and the power to do these wonders?

   ^55Is he not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother named Mary, and are
   not his brothers named James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?

   ^56And do not all his sisters live here among us? Then where did he get
   all this?"

   ^57And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them,

   "A prophet is treated with honor everywhere except in his native place
   and at his home."

   ^58And he did not do many wonders there, because of their want of
   faith.

  Chapter 14

   ^1At that time, Herod the governor heard the reports about Jesus,

   ^2and he said to his attendants,

   "This man must be John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead, and
   that is why wonderful powers are working through him."

   ^3For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, on
   account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,

   ^4for John said to him,

   "It is not right for you to be living with her."

   ^5And while he wanted him killed, he was afraid of the people; for they
   considered him a prophet.

   ^6But when Herod's birthday came, Herodias' daughter danced before the
   company. And Herod was delighted with her,

   ^7and swore that he would give her anything she asked for.

   ^8But she, at her mother's instigation, said,

   "Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter!"

   ^9And the king was sorry, but because he had sworn to do it, and
   because of the guests who were present, he ordered it to be given to
   her.

   ^10And he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.

   ^11And his head was brought back on a platter and given to the girl,
   and she took it to her mother.

   ^12John's disciples came and took his body away, and buried him, and
   then they went and reported it to Jesus.

   ^13When Jesus heard it, he quietly retired by boat to a secluded place.
   And the crowds heard of it and followed him on foot from the towns.

   ^14So when he got out of the boat he found a great crowd gathered, and
   his heart was touched at the sight of them, and he cured those of them
   that were sick.

   ^15And when it was evening, the disciples came up to him and said,

   "This is a lonely place and the day is over. Send the crowds off to the
   villages to buy themselves food."

   ^16But Jesus said to them,

   "They do not need to go away. Give them food yourselves."

   ^17They said to him,

   "We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish."

   ^18He said,

   "Bring them here to me."

   ^19Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and he took the
   five loaves and the two fish and looked up to heaven and blessed them,
   and he broke the loaves in pieces and gave them to the disciples and
   they gave them to the people.

   ^20And they all ate and had enough. And the pieces left over that they
   gathered up filled twelve baskets.

   ^21There were about five thousand men who were fed, besides women and
   children.

   ^22And he immediately made his disciples get into the boat and cross
   before him to the other side while he dismissed the crowds.

   ^23After he had dismissed them he went up the hill by himself to pray.
   And when evening came on he was there alone,

   ^24but the boat was by this time a long way from shore, struggling with
   the waves, for the wind was against them.

   ^25Toward morning he went out to them, walking on the sea.

   ^26And the disciples saw him walking on the sea, and they were
   terrified and said,

   "It is a ghost!"

   And they screamed with fear.

   ^27But Jesus immediately spoke to them and said,

   "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."

   ^28Peter answered,

   "If it is you, Master, order me to come to you on the water."

   ^29And he said,

   "Come!"

   And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and went to
   Jesus.

   ^30But when he felt the wind he was frightened, and beginning to sink,
   he cried out,

   "Master, save me!"

   ^31Jesus immediately stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and
   said to him,

   "Why did you waver? You have so little faith!"

   ^32When they got into the boat, the wind went down.

   ^33And the men in the boat fell down before him and said,

   "You are certainly God's Son!"

   ^34And they crossed over to the other side and came to Gennesaret.

   ^35And the men of the place recognized him, and sent all over that
   district and brought to him all who were sick,

   ^36and they begged him to let them touch just the tassel of his cloak,
   and all who touched it were cured.

  Chapter 15

   ^1Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and
   said to him,

   ^2"Why do your disciples break the rules handed down by our ancestors?
   For they eat their bread without first washing their hands."

   ^3But he answered,

   "Why do you too break God's command for the sake of what has been
   handed down to you?

   ^4For God said, Honor your father and mother,' and He who abuses his
   father or mother must be put to death.'

   ^5But you say, Whoever tells his father or mother, "Anything of mine
   that might have been of use to you is given to God,"

   ^6does not have to provide for his father.' So you have nullified what
   God has said, for the sake of what has been handed down to you.

   ^7You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied finely about you when he said,

   ^8" This people honor me with their lips,

   Yet their hearts are far away from me.

   ^9But their worship of me is all in vain,

   For the lessons they teach are but human precepts.' "

   ^10And he called the people to him and said to them,

   ^11"Listen to this, and grasp it! It is not what goes into a man's
   mouth that pollutes him; it is what comes out of his mouth that
   pollutes a man."

   ^12Then his disciples came up to him and said to him,

   "Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked to hear you say that?"

   ^13But he answered,

   "Any plant that my heavenly Father did not plant must be uprooted!

   ^14Leave them alone. They are blind guides! But if one blind man leads
   another, they will both fall into the ditch!"

   ^15Peter said to him,

   "Explain the figure for us."

   ^16He said,

   "Have even you no understanding yet?

   ^17Can you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the
   stomach and then is disposed of?

   ^18But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and
   they pollute a man.

   ^19For out of the heart come wicked designs, murder, adultery,
   immorality, stealing, false witness, impious speech.

   ^20It is these things that pollute a man, but not eating with unwashed
   hands!"

   ^21And Jesus left that place and retired to the neighborhood of Tyre
   and Sidon.

   ^22And a Canaanite woman of that district came out and screamed,

   "Son of David, take pity on me, sir! My daughter is dreadfully
   possessed by a demon!"

   ^23But he would not answer her a word. And his disciples came up and
   urged him, saying,

   "Send her away, for she keeps screaming after us."

   ^24But he answered,

   "I am sent only to the lost sheep of Israel's house."

   ^25And she came and fell down before him, and said,

   "Help me, sir!"

   ^26He said,

   "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the
   dogs!"

   ^27But she said,

   "O yes, sir! For even dogs eat the scraps that fall from their masters'
   table!"

   ^28Then Jesus answered,

   "You have great faith! You shall have what you want."

   And her daughter was cured from that time.

   ^29Jesus left that place and went along the shore of the Sea of
   Galilee, and went up on the hillside and sat down there.

   ^30Then great crowds came to him bringing with them those who were
   lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. And they laid them
   down at his feet, and he cured them,

   ^31so that the people were astonished to see the dumb speak, the lame
   walk, and the blind see. And they praised the God of Israel.

   ^32Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them,

   "I pity these people for they have been staying with me three days now
   and they have nothing left to eat, and I do not mean to send them away
   hungry, for they may give out on the way."

   ^33The disciples said to him,

   "Where can we get bread enough in this solitude to feed such a crowd?"

   ^34Jesus said to them,

   "How many loaves have you?"

   They said,

   "Seven, and a few small fish."

   ^35Then he ordered the people to take their places on the ground,

   ^36and he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks and he
   broke them in pieces and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples
   gave them to the people.

   ^37And they all ate and satisfied their hunger. And the pieces that
   they left that were picked up filled seven baskets.

   ^38There were four thousand men who were fed, besides women and
   children.

   ^39And he dismissed the people and got into the boat and went to the
   district of Magadan.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   ^1The Pharisees and Sadducees came up and to test him asked him to show
   them a sign from heaven.

   ^2He answered,

   ^4"It is a wicked and faithless age that insists on a sign, and no sign
   will be given it but the sign of Jonah."

   And he left them and went away.

   ^5When the disciples went across the lake, they forgot to take any
   bread.

   ^6And Jesus said to them,

   "Look out, and be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and
   Sadducees!"

   ^7But they were discussing something with one another, and saying,

   "We have not brought any bread!"

   ^8Jesus noticed it and said,

   "Why are you discussing with one another your being without bread? You
   have so little faith!

   ^9Do you not understand yet? Do you not remember the five loaves for
   the five thousand, and how many baskets full you gathered up?

   ^10Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets
   full you gathered up?

   ^11Why do you not see that I was not talking to you about bread? But be
   on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"

   ^12Then they understood that he was warning them not against yeast but
   against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

   ^13When Jesus reached the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
   disciples,

   "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"

   ^14They said,

   "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or
   one of the prophets."

   ^15He said to them,

   "But who do you say that I am?"

   ^16Simon Peter answered,

   "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!"

   ^17Jesus answered,

   "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for human nature has not
   disclosed this to you, but my Father in heaven!

   ^18But I tell you, your name is Peter, a rock, and on this rock I will
   build my church, and the powers of death shall not subdue it.

   ^19I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you
   forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and whatever
   you permit on earth will be held in heaven to be permitted."

   ^20Then he warned the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the
   Christ.

   ^21It was then that Jesus Christ for the first time explained to his
   disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem and endure great suffering
   there at the hands of the elders, high priests, and scribes, and be
   killed, and be raised to life on the third day.

   ^22And Peter took him aside and began to reprove him for it, saying,

   "God bless you, Master! that can never happen to you!"

   ^23But he turned and said to Peter,

   "Get out of my sight, you Satan! You hinder me, for you do not side
   with God, but with men!"

   ^24Then Jesus said to his disciples,

   "If anyone wants to go with me, he must disregard himself and take his
   cross and follow me.

   ^25For whoever wants to preserve his own life will lose it, and whoever
   loses his life for me will find it.

   ^26For what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but parts
   with his life? What can a man give to buy back his life?

   ^27For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in his Father's
   glory, and then he will repay everyone for what he has done.

   ^28I tell you, some of you who stand here will certainly live to see
   the Son of Man come to reign!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   ^1Six days after this, Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John,
   and led them up on a high mountain, by themselves.

   ^2And his appearance underwent a change in their presence and his face
   shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.

   ^3And Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.

   ^4And Peter spoke, and said to Jesus,

   "Master, how good it is that we are here! If you wish, I will make
   three huts here, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

   ^5As he spoke a bright cloud overshadowed them and a voice from the
   cloud said,

   "This is my Son, my Beloved. He is my Chosen. Listen to him!"

   ^6When the disciples heard it, they were dreadfully frightened and fell
   upon their faces.

   ^7And Jesus came and touched them, and said,

   "Get up and do not be afraid."

   ^8When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus himself.

   ^9And as they were going down the mountain, Jesus cautioned them,
   saying,

   "Do not tell anyone of the vision you have seen until the Son of Man is
   raised from the dead."

   ^10The disciples asked him,

   "Then why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first?"

   ^11He answered,

   "Elijah does come and is to reform everything,

   ^12but I tell you, Elijah has come already, and they would not
   recognize him, but treated him just as they pleased. It is in just that
   way that the Son of Man is going to be treated by them!"

   ^13Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John
   the Baptist.

   ^14When they came to the people again, a man came up to him and fell on
   his knees, saying,

   ^15"Master, take pity on my son, for he has epilepsy, and is very
   wretched; he often falls into the fire or into the water.

   ^16And I brought him to your disciples and they have not been able to
   cure him."

   ^17Jesus answered,

   "O you unbelieving, obstinate people! How long must I be with you? How
   long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!"

   ^18And Jesus reproved the demon and it came out of him, and from that
   moment the boy was cured.

   ^19Afterward, when he was alone, the disciples went to Jesus and said
   to him,

   "Why could we not drive it out?"

   ^20He said to them,

   "Because you have so little faith. For I tell you, if you have faith
   the size of a grain of mustard, you can say to this mountain, Move from
   here over to there!' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible
   for you."

   ^22As they were going about in Galilee, Jesus said to them,

   "The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men,

   ^23and they will kill him, but on the third day he will be raised to
   life again." And they were greatly distressed.

   ^24When they reached Capernaum, the collectors of the temple-tax came
   and said to Peter,

   "Does not your Master pay the temple-tax?"

   ^25He said,

   "Yes."

   But when he went home, Jesus spoke of it first and said,

   "What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect duties
   and taxes? From their own people, or from aliens?"

   ^26He said,

   "From aliens."

   Jesus said to him,

   "Then their own people are exempt.

   ^27But rather than give offense to them, go down to the sea and throw
   in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, open its mouth and you
   will find in it a dollar. Take that and pay the tax for us both."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 18

   ^1Just at that time the disciples came up and asked Jesus,

   "Who is really greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"

   ^2He called a child to him and had him stand among them,

   ^3and he said,

   "I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never
   get into the Kingdom of Heaven at all.

   ^4Anyone, therefore, who is as unassuming as this child is the greatest
   in the Kingdom of Heaven,

   ^5and anyone who welcomes one child like this on my account welcomes
   me.

   ^6But whoever hinders one of these children who believe in me might
   better have a great millstone hung around his neck and be sunk in the
   open sea.

   ^7Alas for the world for such hindrances! They have to come, but alas
   for the man who causes them!

   ^8"But if your own hand or your own foot makes you fall, cut it off and
   throw it away. You might better enter upon life maimed or crippled than
   keep both hands and feet but be thrown into the everlasting fire.

   ^9And if your own eye makes you fall, dig it out and throw it away. You
   might better enter upon life with only one eye than be thrown with both
   eyes into the fiery pit.

   ^10"Beware of feeling scornful of one single little child, for I tell
   you that in heaven their angels have continual access to my Father in
   heaven.

   ^12What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them
   strays away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills, and go in
   search of the one that is astray?

   ^13And if he happens to find it, I tell you he rejoices more over it
   than he does over the ninety-nine that did not stray.

   ^14In just that way, it is the will of my Father in heaven that not a
   single one of these children be lost.

   ^15"But if your brother wrongs you go to him and show him his fault
   while you are alone with him. If he listens to you, you have won back
   your brother.

   ^16But if he will not listen, take one or two others with you, so that
   everything may be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

   ^17If he refuses to listen to them, tell the congregation. And if he
   refuses to listen to it, treat him as a heathen or a tax-collector.

   ^18"I tell you, whatever you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to
   be forbidden, and whatever you permit on earth will be held in heaven
   to be permitted.

   ^19Again, I tell you, if even two of you here on earth agree about what
   they shall pray for, it will be given them by my Father in heaven.

   ^20For wherever two or three are gathered as my followers, I am there
   among them."

   ^21Then Peter came to him and said,

   "Master, how many times am I to forgive my brother when he wrongs me?
   Seven times over?"

   ^22Jesus said to him,

   "Not seven times over, I tell you, but seventy-seven times over!

   ^23For this reason the Kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a king, who
   resolved to settle accounts with his slaves.

   ^24And when he set about doing so, a man was brought in who owed him
   ten million dollars.

   ^25And as he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his
   wife and children and all he had, in payment of the debt.

   ^26So the slave threw himself down before him and implored him, Give me
   time, and I will pay you all of it.'

   ^27And his master's heart was touched, and he let the slave go and
   canceled the debt.

   ^28But when the slave went out he met a fellow-slave of his who owed
   him twenty dollars, and he caught him by the throat and began to choke
   him, saying, Pay me what you owe!'

   ^29So his fellow-slave threw himself down before him, and begged him,
   Give me time, and I will pay you.'

   ^30But he refused and went and had him put in prison until he should
   pay the debt.

   ^31When his fellow-slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly
   distressed, and they went to their master and reported the whole matter
   to him.

   ^32Then his master called him in and said to him, You wicked slave! I
   canceled all that debt of yours when you entreated me.

   ^33Ought you not to have taken pity on your fellow-slave, as I did on
   you?'

   ^34So his master in his anger handed him over to the jailers, until he
   should pay all he owed him.

   ^35That is what my heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not each
   forgive your brothers from your hearts!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   ^1When Jesus had finished this discourse, he left Galilee and went to
   the part of Judea that is on the other side of the Jordan.

   ^2Great crowds followed him about and he cured them there.

   ^3And some Pharisees came up to him to test him, and they said,

   "Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"

   ^4But he answered,

   "Did you never read that the Creator at the beginning made them male
   and female,

   ^5and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and
   be united to his wife, and the two of them shall become one'? So they
   are no longer two but one.

   ^6Therefore, what God has joined together, man must not try to
   separate."

   ^7They said to him,

   "Then why did Moses command us to draw up a written divorce-notice and
   give it to her?"

   ^8He said to them,

   "It was on account of your perversity that Moses permitted you to
   divorce your wives, but it was not so at the beginning.

   ^9I tell you that whoever divorces his wife on any ground but her
   unfaithfulness, and marries another woman, commits adultery."

   ^10The disciples said to him,

   "If that is a man's relation to his wife, it is better not to marry!"

   ^11He said to them,

   "It is not everyone who can accept that, but only those who have a
   special gift.

   ^12For some are incapable of marriage from their birth, and some have
   been made so by men, and some have made themselves so for the sake of
   the Kingdom of Heaven. Let him accept it who can."

   ^13Then some children were brought up to him so that he might lay his
   hands on them and pray, but his disciples reproved the people for it.

   ^14But Jesus said,

   "Let the children alone, and do not try to keep them from coming to me,
   for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as they are."

   ^15And he laid his hands on them and went on.

   ^16A man came up to him and said,

   "Master, what good deed must I do to obtain eternal life?"

   ^17But he said to him,

   "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good.

   But if you want to enter that life, keep the commandments."

   ^18He said to him,

   "Which ones?"

   Jesus said,

   "These: You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall
   not steal, You shall not bear false witness,

   ^19Honor your father and mother,' and You shall love your neighbor as
   you do yourself.' "

   ^20The young man said to him,

   "I have obeyed all these commandments. What do I still lack?"

   ^21Jesus said to him,

   "If you want to be perfect, go! Sell your property and give the money
   to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come back and be
   a follower of mine."

   ^22But when the young man heard that, he went away much cast down, for
   he had a great deal of property.

   ^23Jesus said to his disciples,

   "I tell you, it will be hard for a rich man to get into the Kingdom of
   Heaven!

   ^24And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to get through a
   needle's eye than for a rich man to get into the Kingdom of God!"

   ^25But when the disciples heard this, they were completely astounded
   and said,

   "Then who can be saved?"

   ^26But Jesus looked at them and said,

   "For men it is impossible, but anything is possible for God!"

   ^27Then Peter spoke and said to him, "Here we have left all we had and
   followed you. What are we to have?"

   ^28Jesus said to them,

   "In the new world, I tell you, when the Son of Man takes his seat on
   his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit upon twelve
   thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel!

   ^29And anyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father
   or mother or children or land for my sake will receive many times as
   much, and share eternal life.

   ^30But many who are first now will be last then, and many who are now
   last will be first.

  Chapter 20

   ^1For the Kingdom of Heaven is like an employer who went out early in
   the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.

   ^2He agreed with the laborers to pay them a dollar a day, and sent them
   to his vineyard.

   ^3He went out about nine o'clock and saw others standing in the bazaar
   with nothing to do.

   ^4And he said to them, You go to my vineyard, too, and I will pay you
   whatever is right.' So they went.

   ^5He went out again about twelve and about three, and did the same.

   ^6About five he went out and found others standing about and he said to
   them, Why have you been standing about here all day doing nothing?'

   ^7They said to him, Because nobody has hired us.' He said to them, You
   go to my vineyard, too.'

   ^8When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman,
   Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and
   ending with the first.'

   ^9When those who were hired about five o'clock came they received a
   dollar apiece.

   ^10And when those who were hired first came they expected to get more,
   but they too got a dollar apiece.

   ^11And when they received it they grumbled at their employer,

   ^12and said, These men who were hired last worked only one hour, and
   you have put them on the same footing with us who have done the heavy
   work of the day and have stood the midday heat.'

   ^13But he answered one of them, My friend, I am doing you no injustice.
   Did you not agree with me on a dollar?

   ^14Take what belongs to you and go. I wish to give the last man hired
   as much as I give you.

   ^15Have I no right to do what I please with what is mine? Or do you
   begrudge my generosity?'

   ^16So those who are last now will be first then, and those who are
   first will be last."

   ^17When Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve off
   by themselves, and said to them as they were on the way,

   ^18"We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed
   over to the high priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to
   death,

   ^19and hand him over to the heathen to be mocked and flogged and
   crucified, and on the third day he will be raised to life."

   ^20Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came up to him with her sons,
   bowing low, to ask a favor of him.

   ^21He said to her,

   "What do you want?"

   She said to him,

   "Give orders that these two sons of mine sit one at your right and one
   at your left, when you are king!"

   ^22But Jesus answered,

   "You do not know what you are asking for! Can you drink what I am going
   to drink?"

   They answered,

   "Yes, we can."

   ^23He said to them,

   "Then what I drink you shall drink, but as for sitting at my right or
   my left, that is not mine to give, but belongs to those for whom it is
   destined by my Father."

   ^24When the other ten heard of this, they were very indignant at the
   two brothers.

   ^25But Jesus called them to him and said,

   "You know that the rulers of the heathen lord it over them, and their
   great men tyrannize over them.

   ^26It is not to be so among you, but whoever wants to be great among
   you must be your servant,

   ^27and whoever wants to hold the first place among you must be your
   slave,

   ^28just as the Son of Man has come not to be waited on, but to wait on
   other people, and to give his life to ransom many others."

   ^29As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.

   ^30And two blind men sitting by the roadside, hearing that it was Jesus
   who was passing, called out,

   "You Son of David! Take pity on us, sir!"

   ^31The crowd told them to be still, but they called all the louder,

   "You Son of David! Take pity on us, sir!"

   ^32And Jesus stopped and called them, and said,

   "What do you want me to do for you?"

   ^33They said to him,

   "Sir, have our eyes opened!"

   ^34And Jesus took pity on them and touched their eyes, and they
   immediately regained their sight, and followed him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 21

   ^1When they were near Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage and the Mount
   of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples on ahead,

   ^2saying to them,

   "Go to the village that lies in front of you, and you will at once find
   an ass tied there, and a colt with her. Untie her and bring them to me.

   ^3If anyone says anything to you, you are to say, The Master needs
   them'; then he will send them at once."

   ^4Now this happened in fulfilment of what was said by the prophet,

   ^5"Tell the daughter of Zion,

   Here is your king coming to you,

   Gentle, and riding on an ass,

   And on the foal of a beast of burden.' "

   ^6So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them;

   ^7they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their coats upon them,
   and Jesus seated himself upon them.

   ^8And most of the crowd spread their coats in his way, and others cut
   branches from the trees and scattered them before him.

   ^9And the crowds that went in front of him and that followed him
   shouted,

   "God bless the Son of David!

   Blessed be he who comes in the Lord's name.

   God bless him from on high!"

   ^10When he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and
   everyone asked,

   "Who is he?"

   ^11The crowd answered,

   "It is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth in Galilee!"

   ^12And Jesus went into the Temple and drove out all who were buying or
   selling things in it, and he upset the money-changers' tables and the
   pigeon-dealers' seats,

   ^13and he said to them,

   "The Scripture says, My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but
   you make it a robbers' cave."

   ^14And blind and lame people came up to him in the Temple, and he cured
   them.

   ^15But when the high priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he
   did and saw the boys shouting in the Temple, "God bless the Son of
   David!" they were indignant,

   ^16and said to him,

   "Do you hear what they are saying?"

   Jesus said to them,

   "Yes. Did you never read, You have drawn praise from the mouths of
   children and infants'?"

   ^17And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the
   night there.

   ^18In the morning as he went back to the city, he grew hungry,

   ^19and seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found
   nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it,

   "No more fruit shall ever grow on you!"

   And the fig tree withered up at once.

   ^20When the disciples saw it, they were amazed and said,

   "How did the fig tree come to wither up immediately?"

   ^21Jesus answered,

   "I tell you, if you have faith and have no doubt, you will not only do
   what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain,
   Get up and throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done.

   ^22And everything that you pray for with faith, you will obtain."

   ^23When he had entered the Temple, and was teaching, the high priests
   and the elders of the people came up to him, and said,

   "What authority have you for doing as you do, and who gave you this
   authority?"

   ^24Jesus answered,

   "Let me ask you one question, and if you answer it, I will tell you
   what authority I have for doing as I do.

   ^25Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from
   men?"

   And they argued with one another,

   "If we say, It was from heaven,' he will say to us, Then why did you
   not believe him?'

   ^26But if we say, From men,' we have the people to fear, for they all
   consider John a prophet."

   ^27And they answered Jesus,

   "We do not know."

   He said to them,

   "Nor will I tell you what authority I have for doing as I do.

   ^28But what do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to
   the first and said, My son, go and work in the vineyard today.'

   ^29And he answered, I will, sir,' but he did not go.

   ^30Then the man went to the second son, and told him the same thing.
   And he answered, I will not!' But afterward he changed his mind and
   went.

   ^31Which of the two did what his father wanted?"

   They said,

   "The second one."

   Jesus said to them,

   "I tell you, the tax-collectors and prostitutes are going into the
   Kingdom of God ahead of you.

   ^32For John came to you with a way of uprightness, and you would not
   believe him. The tax-collectors and prostitutes believed him, but even
   after seeing that, you would not change your minds and believe him!

   ^33"Listen to another figure. There was a land owner who planted a
   vineyard and fenced it in, and hewed out a wine-vat in it, and built a
   watch-tower, and leased it to tenants, and left the neighborhood.

   ^34When the time for the vintage approached he sent his slaves to the
   tenants to receive his share.

   ^35But the tenants took his slaves and beat one and killed another and
   stoned a third.

   ^36Again he sent other slaves and more of them than he had sent at
   first, and they treated them in the same way.

   ^37Finally he sent his son to them, thinking, They will respect my
   son.'

   ^38But when the tenants saw his son, they said to one another. This is
   his heir! Come on, let us kill him, and get his inheritance!'

   ^39So they took him and drove him out of the vineyard and killed him.

   ^40When the owner of the vineyard comes back, therefore, what will he
   do to these tenants?"

   ^41They said to him,

   "He will put the wretches to a miserable death, and let the vineyard to
   other tenants who will give him his share of the vintage when it is
   due."

   ^42Jesus said to them,

   "Did you never read in the Scriptures,

   " That stone which the builders rejected

   Has become the cornerstone;

   This came from the Lord,

   And seems marvelous to us'?

   ^43"That, I tell you, is why the Kingdom of God will be taken away from
   you, and given to a people that will produce its proper fruit.

   ^44Whoever falls on that stone will be shattered, but whoever it falls
   upon will be pulverized."

   ^45When the high priests and the Pharisees heard his figures, they knew
   that he was speaking about them,

   ^46and they wanted to have him arrested, but they were afraid of the
   people, for the people considered him a prophet.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 22

   ^1And Jesus spoke to them again in figures, and said,

   ^2"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king, who gave a wedding banquet for
   his son.

   ^3And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the
   banquet, and they would not come.

   ^4He sent other slaves a second time, and said to them, Tell those who
   have been asked, "Here I have my banquet all ready, my bullocks and fat
   cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!" '

   ^5But they took no notice of it, and went off, one to his estate, and
   another to his business,

   ^6and the rest seized his slaves, and ill treated them and killed them.

   ^7This made the king angry, and he sent his troops and put those
   murderers to death and burned their city.

   ^8Then he said to his slaves, The banquet is ready, but those who were
   invited have proved unworthy of it.

   ^9So go out where the roads leave the city and invite everyone you find
   to the banquet.'

   ^10So his slaves went out on the roads, and got together all the people
   they could find, good or bad, and the hall was filled with guests.

   ^11But when the king came in to view the guests, he saw among them a
   man who did not have on wedding clothes.

   ^12And he said to him, My friend, how did you happen to come here
   without wedding clothes?' But he had nothing to say.

   ^13Then the king said to his attendants, Bind him hand and foot and
   throw him out into the darkness, there to weep and grind his teeth.'

   ^14For many are invited but few chosen."

   ^15Then the Pharisees went and made a plot to entrap him in argument.

   ^16So they sent their disciples to him with the Herodians, to say to
   him,

   "Master, we know that you tell the truth, and teach the way of God with
   sincerity, regardless of the consequences, for you are impartial.

   ^17So give us your opinion: Is it right to pay the poll-tax to the
   emperor, or not?"

   ^18But he saw their malice, and said,

   ^19"Why do you put me to such a test, you hypocrites? Show me the
   poll-tax coin!"

   And they brought him a denarius.

   ^20And he said to them,

   "Whose head and title is this?"

   ^21They answered,

   "The emperor's."

   Then he said to them,

   "Then pay the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and pay God what
   belongs to God!"

   ^22And when they heard it they were amazed, and they went away and left
   him.

   ^23On the same day some Sadducees came up to him, claiming that there
   is no resurrection, and they asked him this question:

   ^24"Master, Moses said, If a man dies without children his brother
   shall marry his widow, and raise up a family for him.'

   ^25Now there were seven brothers among us. The first of them married
   and died, and as he had no children, he left his wife to his brother;

   ^26so did the second, and the third, and the rest of the seven.

   ^27After them all the woman died.

   ^28At the resurrection which one's wife will she be? For they all
   married her."

   ^29Jesus answered them,

   "You are wrong, because you do not understand the Scriptures nor the
   power of God.

   ^30For after the resurrection there is no marrying or being married,
   but they live as angels do in heaven.

   ^31But as to the resurrection of the dead, did you never read what was
   said to you by God,

   ^32I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He
   is not the God of dead men but of living!"

   ^33When the crowd heard this, they were astounded at his teaching.

   ^34And when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees,
   they gathered together,

   ^35and one of them, an expert in the Law, to test him, asked,

   ^36"Master, what command is greatest in the Law?"

   ^37And he said to him,

   " You must love the Lord your God with your whole heart, your whole
   soul, and your whole mind.'

   ^38That is the great, first command.

   ^39There is a second like it: You must love your neighbor as you do
   yourself.'

   ^40These two commands sum up the whole of the Law and the Prophets."

   ^41While the Pharisees were still gathered there, Jesus asked them,

   ^42"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"

   They said to him,

   "David's."

   ^43He said to them,

   "How is it then that David under the Spirit's influence calls him lord,
   and says,

   ^44" The Lord has said to my lord, "Sit at my right hand,

   Until I put your enemies under your feet" '?

   ^45So if David calls him lord, how can he be his son?"

   ^46And no one could make him any answer, and from that day no one
   ventured to ask him any more questions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 23

   ^1Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,

   ^2"The scribes and Pharisees have taken Moses' seat.

   ^3So do everything they tell you, and observe it all, but do not do as
   they do, for they talk but do not act.

   ^4They tie up heavy loads and have them put on men's shoulders, but
   they will not lift a finger to move them.

   ^5They do everything they do to have men see it. They wear wide
   Scripture texts as charms, and they wear large tassels,

   ^6and they like the best places at dinners and the front seats in the
   synagogues,

   ^7and to be saluted with respect in public places, and to have men call
   them Rabbi.'

   ^8But you must not let people call you Rabbi,' for you have only one
   teacher, and you are all brothers.

   ^9And you must not call anyone on earth your father, for you have only
   one father, your heavenly Father.

   ^10And you must not let men call you master, for you have only one
   master, the Christ.

   ^11But he who is greatest among you must be your servant.

   ^12Whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself
   will be exalted.

   ^13"But alas for you, you hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, for you
   lock the doors of the Kingdom of Heaven in men's faces, for you will
   neither go in yourselves nor let those enter who are trying to do so.

   ^15Alas for you, you hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, for you scour
   land and sea to make one convert, and when he is converted you make him
   twice as fit for the pit as you are.

   ^16Alas for you, you blind guides, who say, If anyone swears by the
   sanctuary, it does not matter, but if anyone swears by the gold of the
   sanctuary, it is binding.'

   ^17Blind fools! which is greater, the gold, or the sanctuary that makes
   the gold sacred?

   ^18You say, If anyone swears by the altar, it does not matter, but if
   anyone swears by the offering that is on it, it is binding.'

   ^19You blind men! Which is greater, the offering, or the altar that
   makes the offering sacred?

   ^20Anyone who swears by the altar is swearing by it and by everything
   that is on it,

   ^21and anyone who swears by the sanctuary is swearing by it and by him
   who dwells in it;

   ^22and anyone who swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God and
   by him who sits upon it.

   ^23"Alas for you, you hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, for you pay
   tithes on mint, dill, and cummin, and you have let the weightier
   matters of the Law go--justice, mercy, and integrity. But you should
   have observed these, without overlooking the others.

   ^24You blind guides! straining out the gnat, and yet swallowing the
   camel!

   ^25Alas for you, you hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, for you clean
   the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed
   and self-indulgence.

   ^26You blind Pharisee! You must first clean the inside of the cup and
   the dish, so that the outside may be clean too.

   ^27Alas for you, you hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, for you are
   like white-washed tombs! They look well on the outside, but inside they
   are full of the bones of the dead, and all that is unclean.

   ^28So you outwardly appear to men to be upright, but within you are
   full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

   ^29"Alas for you, you hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, for you build
   tombs for the prophets, and decorate the monuments of the upright,

   ^30and say, If we had been living in the times of our fathers, we would
   not have joined them in the murder of the prophets.'

   ^31So you bear witness against yourselves that you are descended from
   the murderers of the prophets.

   ^32Go on and fill up the measure of your forefathers' guilt.

   ^33You serpents! You brood of snakes! How can you escape being
   sentenced to the pit?

   ^34This is why I am going to send you prophets, wise men and scribes,
   some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your
   synagogues and hunt from one town to another;

   ^35it is that on your heads may come all the righteous blood shed on
   the earth from the blood of Abel the upright to the blood of Zechariah,
   Barachiah's son, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar!

   ^36I tell you, all this will come upon this age!

   ^37"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! murdering the prophets, and stoning those
   who are sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children
   around me, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you refused!

   ^38Now I leave you to yourselves.

   ^39For I tell you, you will never see me again until you say, Blessed
   be he who comes in the Lord's name!' "
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 24

   ^1And Jesus left the Temple and was going away, when his disciples came
   up to him to call his attention to the Temple buildings.

   ^2But he answered,

   "Do you see all this? I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon
   another but shall be torn down."

   ^3As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came up to
   him by themselves, and said to him,

   "Tell us when this is to happen, and what will be the sign of your
   coming, and of the close of the age."

   ^4Jesus answered,

   "Take care that no one misleads you about this.

   ^5For many will come under my name, and say, I am the Christ,' and many
   will be misled by them.

   ^6You will hear of wars and rumors of war; do not let yourselves be
   alarmed. They have to come, but that is not the end.

   ^7For nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against
   kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes here and there.

   ^8All this is only the beginning of the sufferings.

   ^9Then they will hand you over to persecution and they will put you to
   death, and you will be hated by all the heathen because you bear my
   name.

   ^10Then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one
   another.

   ^11Many false prophets will appear, and many will be misled by them,

   ^12and because of the increase of wickedness, most men's love will grow
   cold.

   ^13But he who holds out to the end will be saved.

   ^14And this good news of the kingdom will be preached all over the
   world, to testify to all the heathen, and then the end will come.

   ^15"So when you see the dreadful desecration, of which the prophet
   Daniel spoke, set up in the Holy Place"--the reader must take note of
   this--

   ^16"then those who are in Judea must fly to the hills;

   ^17a man on the roof of his house must not go down to get things out of
   it,

   ^18and a man in the field must not turn back to get his coat.

   ^19But alas for women who are with child at that time or who have
   babies!

   ^20And pray that you may not have to fly in winter or on the Sabbath,

   ^21for there will be greater misery then than there has ever been from
   the beginning of creation until now, or ever will be again.

   ^22If those days had not been cut short, nobody would have escaped, but
   for the sake of God's people those days will be cut short.

   ^23"If anyone says to you at that time, Look! here is the Christ!' or
   There he is!' do not believe it,

   ^24for false Christs and false prophets will appear, and they will show
   great signs and wonders to mislead God's chosen people if they can.

   ^25Here I have told you beforehand.

   ^26So if they say to you, There he is, in the desert!' do not go out
   there; Here he is, in a room in here!' do not believe it.

   ^27For just as the lightning starts in the east and flashes to the
   west, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.

   ^28Wherever there is a dead body, the vultures will flock.

   ^29"But immediately after the misery of those days, the sun will be
   darkened, and the moon will not shed its light, and the stars will fall
   from the sky, and the forces of the sky will shake.

   ^30Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the
   nations of the earth will lament when they see the Son of Man coming on
   the clouds of the sky, in all his power and splendor.

   ^31And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet-call, and they
   will gather his chosen people from the four winds, from one end of the
   sky to the other.

   ^32"Let the fig tree teach you the lesson. As soon as its branches grow
   soft and put forth leaves, you know that summer is coming.

   ^33So when you see all these things, you must know that he is just at
   the door.

   ^34I tell you, these things will all happen before the present age
   passes away.

   ^35Earth and sky will pass away but my words will never pass away.

   ^36But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in
   heaven nor the Son, but only the Father.

   ^37For just as it was in the time of Noah, it will be at the coming of
   the Son of Man.

   ^38For just as in those days before the flood people were eating and
   drinking, marrying and being married, until the very day Noah entered
   the ark,

   ^39and knew nothing about it until the flood came and destroyed them
   all, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

   ^40Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.

   ^41Two women will be grinding with the handmill; one will be taken and
   one left.

   ^42So you must be on the watch, for you do not know on what day your
   Master is coming.

   ^43But you may be sure of this, that if the master of the house had
   known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have
   been on the watch, and would not have let his house be broken into.

   ^44Therefore you must be ready too, for the Son of Man is coming at a
   time when you do not expect him.

   ^45"Who then will be the faithful, thoughtful slave whom his master put
   in charge of his household, to give the members of it their supplies at
   the proper time?

   ^46Blessed is that slave if his master when he returns finds him doing
   it.

   ^47I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his property.

   ^48But if he is a bad slave and says to himself, My master is going to
   stay a long time,'

   ^49and begins to beat the other slaves, and eats and drinks with
   drunkards,

   ^50that slave's master will come back some day when he does not expect
   him, and at some time of which he does not know

   ^51and will cut him in two, and put him with the hypocrites, to weep
   and gnash his teeth.

  Chapter 25

   ^1"Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took
   their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

   ^2Now five of them were foolish and five were sensible.

   ^3For the foolish ones brought their lamps but brought no oil with
   them,

   ^4but the sensible ones with their lamps brought oil in their flasks.

   ^5As the bridegroom was slow in coming, they all grew drowsy and fell
   asleep.

   ^6But in the middle of the night there was a shout Here is the
   bridegroom! Come out and meet him!'

   ^7Then all the bridesmaids awoke, and trimmed their lamps.

   ^8And the foolish ones said to the sensible ones, Give us some of your
   oil, for our lamps are going out.'

   ^9But the sensible ones answered, There may not be enough for us and
   you. You had better go to the dealers and buy yourselves some.'

   ^10But while they were gone to buy it, the bridegroom arrived, and the
   ones that were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the
   door was closed.

   ^11Afterward the other bridesmaids came and said, Sir! Sir! Open the
   door for us!'

   ^12But he answered, I tell you, I do not know you!'

   ^13So you must be on the watch, for you do not know either the day or
   the hour.

   ^14"For it is just like a man who was going on a journey, and called in
   his slaves, and put his property in their hands.

   ^15He gave one five thousand dollars, and another two thousand, and
   another one thousand; to each according to his ability. Then he went
   away.

   ^16The man who had received the five thousand dollars immediately went
   into business with the money, and made five thousand more.

   ^17In the same way the man who had received the two thousand made two
   thousand more.

   ^18But the man who had received the one thousand went away and dug a
   hole in the ground and hid his master's money.

   ^19Long afterward, their master came back and settled accounts with
   them.

   ^20And the man who had received the five thousand dollars came up
   bringing him five thousand more, and said, Sir, you put five thousand
   dollars in my hands; here I have made five thousand more.'

   ^21His master said to him, Well done, my excellent, faithful slave! you
   have been faithful about a small amount; I will put a large one into
   your hands. Come, share your master's enjoyment!'

   ^22And the man who had received the two thousand came up and said, Sir,
   you put two thousand dollars into my hands; here I have made two
   thousand more.'

   ^23His master said to him, Well done, my excellent, faithful slave! you
   have been faithful about a small amount; I will put a large one into
   your hands. Come! share your master's enjoyment.'

   ^24And the man who had received the one thousand came up and said, Sir,
   I knew you were a hard man, who reaped where you had not sown, and
   gathered where you had not threshed,

   ^25and I was frightened, and I went and hid your thousand dollars in
   the ground. Here is your money!'

   ^26His master answered, You wicked, idle slave! You knew that I reaped
   where I had not sown and gathered where I had not threshed?

   ^27Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and then when I
   came back I would have gotten my property with interest.

   ^28So take the thousand dollars away from him, and give it to the man
   who has the ten thousand,

   ^29for the man who has will have more given him, and will be
   plentifully supplied, and from the man who has nothing even what he has
   will be taken away.

   ^30And put the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside, to
   weep and grind his teeth there.'

   ^31"When the Son of Man comes in his splendor, with all his angels with
   him, he will take his seat on his glorious throne,

   ^32and all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will
   separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates his sheep
   from his goats,

   ^33and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his
   left.

   ^34Then the king will say to those at his right, Come, you whom my
   Father has blessed, take possession of the kingdom which has been
   destined for you from the creation of the world.

   ^35For when I was hungry, you gave me food, when I was thirsty you gave
   me something to drink, when I was a stranger, you invited me to your
   homes,

   ^36when I had no clothes, you gave me clothes, when I was sick, you
   looked after me, when I was in prison, you came to see me.'

   ^37Then the upright will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry and
   give you food, or thirsty, and give you something to drink?

   ^38When did we see you a stranger, and invite you home, or without
   clothing, and supply you with it?

   ^39When did we see you sick or in prison, and go to see you?'

   ^40The king will answer, I tell you, in so far as you did it to one of
   the humblest of these brothers of mine, you did it to me.'

   ^41Then he will say to those at his left, Begone, you accursed people,
   to the everlasting fire destined for the devil and his angels!

   ^42For when I was hungry, you gave me nothing to eat, and when I was
   thirsty you gave me nothing to drink,

   ^43when I was a stranger, you did not invite me home, when I had no
   clothes, you did not supply me, when I was sick and in prison, you did
   not look after me.'

   ^44Then they in their turn will answer, Lord, when did we see you
   hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or in need of clothes, or sick, or
   in prison, and did not wait upon you?'

   ^45Then he will answer, I tell you, in so far as you failed to do it
   for one of these people who are humblest, you failed to do it for me.'

   ^46Then they will go away to everlasting punishment, and the upright to
   everlasting life."

  Chapter 26

   ^1When Jesus had finished this discourse he said to his disciples,

   ^2"You know that in two days the Passover Festival will come, and the
   Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

   ^3Then the high priests and the elders of the people gathered in the
   house of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,

   ^4and plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death.

   ^5But they said,

   "It must not be during the festival, or there may be a riot."

   ^6When Jesus got back to Bethany, to the house of Simon the leper,

   ^7a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive
   perfume and poured it upon his head, while he was at table.

   ^8When his disciples saw it, they said indignantly,

   "What was the use of wasting it like that?

   ^9It might have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to the
   poor."

   ^10But Jesus observed this and said to them,

   "Why do you bother the woman? It is a fine thing that she has done to
   me.

   ^11For you always have the poor among you, but you will not always have
   me.

   ^12In pouring this perfume on me she has done something to prepare me
   for burial.

   ^13I tell you, wherever this good news is preached all over the world,
   what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."

   ^14Then one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the high
   priests,

   ^15and said,

   "What will you give me if I hand him over to you?"

   And they counted him out thirty silver pieces.

   ^16And from that time he watched for a good opportunity to hand him
   over to them.

   ^17On the first day of the festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples
   came to Jesus and said,

   "Where do you wish us to make the preparations for you to eat the
   Passover supper?"

   ^18And he said,

   "Go into the city, to a certain man, and say to him, The Master says,
   "My time is near. I am going to keep the Passover at your house with my
   disciples.*#")"

   ^19So the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the
   Passover supper.

   ^20When evening came, he took his place at table with the twelve
   disciples.

   ^21And as they were eating, he said,

   "I tell you, one of you will betray me!"

   ^22They were deeply hurt and began to say to him one after another,

   "Can it be I, Master?"

   ^23He answered,

   "The man who just dipped his hand in the same dish with me is going to
   betray me.

   ^24The Son of Man is to go away as the Scriptures say of him, but alas
   for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been
   better for that man if he had never been born!"

   ^25Judas, who betrayed him, said,

   "Can it be I, Master?"

   He said to him,

   "You are right!"

   ^26As they were eating Jesus took a loaf and blessed it, and he broke
   it in pieces and gave it to his disciples, saying,

   "Take this and eat it. It is my body!"

   ^27And he took the wine-cup and gave thanks and gave it to them,
   saying,

   ^28"You must all drink from it, for this is my blood which ratifies the
   agreement, and is to be poured out for many people, for the forgiveness
   of their sins.

   ^29And I tell you I will never drink this product of the vine again
   till the day when I shall drink the new wine with you in my Father's
   kingdom!"

   ^30After singing the hymn, they went out of the city and up the Mount
   of Olives.

   ^31Then Jesus said to them,

   "You will all desert me tonight, for the Scriptures say, I will strike
   the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'

   ^32But after I am raised to life again, I will go back to Galilee
   before you."

   ^33Peter answered,

   "If they all desert you, I will never do it!"

   ^34Jesus said to him,

   "I tell you, tonight, before a cock crows, you will disown me three
   times!"

   ^35Peter said to him,

   "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you!" All the
   disciples said so too.

   ^36Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said
   to the disciples,

   "Sit down here while I go over yonder and pray."

   ^37And he took Peter and Zebedee's two sons with him, and he began to
   show grief and distress of mind.

   ^38Then he said to them,

   "My heart is almost breaking. You must stay here and keep watch with
   me."

   ^39And he went on a little way, and threw himself on his face, and
   prayed, saying,

   "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass by me. Yet not as I
   please but as you do!"

   ^40When he went back to the disciples he found them asleep. And he said
   to Peter,

   "Then were you not able to watch with me for one hour?

   ^41You must all watch, and pray that you may not be exposed to trial!
   One's spirit is eager, but flesh and blood are weak!"

   ^42He went away again a second time and prayed, saying,

   "My Father, if it cannot pass by me without my drinking it, your will
   be done!"

   ^43When he came back he found them asleep again, for they could hardly
   keep their eyes open.

   ^44And he left them and went away again and prayed a third time, in the
   same words as before.

   ^45Then he came back to the disciples and said to them,

   "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? See, the time has come
   for the Son of Man to be handed over to wicked men!

   ^46Get up! Let us be going! Look! Here comes my betrayer!"

   ^47Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, came up, and with
   him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the high priests and the
   elders of the people.

   ^48Now the man who betrayed him gave them a signal, saying,

   "The one I kiss is the man. Seize him!"

   ^49And he went straight up to Jesus and said,

   "Good evening, Master!" and kissed him affectionately.

   ^50Jesus said to him,

   "My friend, what are you here for?"

   Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and secured him.

   ^51One of the men with Jesus put out his hand and drew his sword, and
   striking at the high priest's slave, cut his ear off.

   ^52Then Jesus said to him,

   "Put your sword back where it belongs! For all who draw the sword will
   die by the sword.

   ^53Do you suppose I cannot appeal to my Father, and he would at once
   furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?

   ^54But then how are the Scriptures to be fulfilled, which say that this
   must happen?"

   ^55At that same time Jesus said to the crowd,

   "Have you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs, as though I were
   a robber? Day after day I have sat in the Temple preaching, and you
   never seized me.

   ^56But this has all taken place in fulfilment of the writings of the
   prophets."

   Then all the disciples left him and made their escape.

   ^57The men who had seized Jesus took him away to Caiaphas, the high
   priest, at whose house the scribes and elders had gathered.

   ^58And Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the
   high priest's house, and he went inside and sat down among the
   attendants to see how it came out.

   ^59Now the high priests and the whole council were trying to get false
   testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.

   ^60And they could not, although many false witnesses presented
   themselves. But finally two came forward

   ^61and said,

   "This man said, I can tear down the sanctuary of God, and build it up
   in three days.' "

   ^62And the high priest got up and said to him,

   "Have you no answer to make? What about their evidence against you?"

   ^63But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him,

   "I charge you, on your oath, by the living God, tell us whether you are
   the Christ, the son of God."

   ^64Jesus said to him,

   "It is true. But I tell you you will soon see the Son of Man seated at
   the right hand of the Almighty and coming upon the clouds of the sky!"

   ^65Then the high priest tore his clothing and said,

   "He has uttered blasphemy! What do we want of witnesses now? Here you
   have heard his blasphemy!

   ^66What is your decision?"

   They answered,

   "He deserves death."

   ^67Then they spat in his face and struck him, and others slapped him,

   ^68saying,

   "Show us you are a prophet, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?"

   ^69Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a maid came up
   to him, and said,

   "You were with Jesus the Galilean, too!"

   ^70But he denied it before them all, and said,

   "I do not know what you mean."

   ^71And he went out into the gateway, and another maid saw him, and said
   to the men there,

   "This fellow was with Jesus the Nazarene!"

   ^72He denied it again, with an oath, and said,

   "I do not know the man!"

   ^73A little while after the bystanders came up to Peter and said,

   "You are certainly one of them too, for your accent shows it!"

   ^74Then he started to swear with the strongest oaths,

   "I do not know the man!"

   And at that moment a cock crowed.

   ^75And Peter remembered Jesus' words when he had said,

   "Before a cock crows, you will disown me three times!" And he went
   outside and wept bitterly.

  Chapter 27

   ^1When it was morning, all the high priests and elders of the people
   held a consultation about Jesus, with a view to putting him to death.

   ^2And they bound him and led him away and handed him over to Pilate the
   governor.

   ^3Then Judas who had betrayed him, when he saw that he had been
   condemned, in his remorse brought back the thirty silver pieces to the
   high priests and elders,

   ^4and said,

   "I did wrong when I handed an innocent man over to death!"

   They said,

   "What is that to us? You see to it yourself."

   ^5And he threw down the silver and left the Temple and went off and
   hung himself.

   ^6The high priests gathered up the money, and they said,

   "It is not legal to put this into the Temple treasury, for it is blood
   money."

   ^7So after consultation they bought with it the Potter's Field as a
   burial ground for strangers.

   ^8For this reason that piece of ground has ever since been called the
   Field of Blood.

   ^9So the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled: "They
   took the thirty silver pieces, the price of the one whose price had
   been fixed, on whom some of the Israelites had set a price,

   ^10and gave them for the Potter's Field as the Lord directed me."

   ^11Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him,

   "Are you the king of the Jews?"

   Jesus said,

   "Yes."

   ^12And while the high priests and elders were making their charges
   against him, he made no answer.

   ^13Then Pilate said to him,

   "Do you not hear what evidence they are bringing against you?"

   ^14And he made him no reply to even a single accusation, so that the
   governor was greatly surprised.

   ^15Now at festival time the governor was accustomed to release for the
   people any prisoner whom they chose,

   ^16and at this time there was a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.

   ^17So when they gathered to ask this, Pilate said to them,

   "Which one do you want me to release for you, Barabbas, or Jesus, the
   so-called Christ?"

   ^18For he knew that they had handed him over to him out of envy.

   ^19Now while he was on the bench his wife sent to him to say,

   "Do not have anything to do with that upright man, for I have just had
   a painful experience in a dream about him."

   ^20But the high priests and the elders prevailed on the crowd to ask
   for Barabbas, and to have Jesus put to death.

   ^21And the governor answered,

   "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?"

   They said,

   "Barabbas!"

   ^22Pilate said to them,

   "Then what am I to do with Jesus, the so-called Christ?"

   They all said,

   "Have him crucified!"

   ^23He said,

   "Why, what has he done that is wrong?"

   But they shouted all the louder,

   "Have him crucified!"

   ^24When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing but that a riot was
   beginning instead, he took some water and washed his hands in the
   presence of the crowd, saying,

   "I am not responsible for this man's death; you must see to it
   yourselves."

   ^25And all the people answered,

   "His blood be on us and on our children!"

   ^26Then he released Barabbas for them, and he had Jesus flogged and
   handed him over to be crucified.

   ^27Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the barracks, and got
   the whole battalion together about him.

   ^28And they stripped him and put a red cloak on him,

   ^29and made a wreath of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a
   stick in his hand, and knelt down before him in mockery, saying,

   "Long live the king of the Jews!"

   ^30And they spat at him, and took the stick and struck him on the head.

   ^31And when they had finished making sport of him, they took off the
   cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be
   crucified.

   ^32As they went out of the city they came upon a Cyrenian named Simon,
   and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.

   ^33When they came to a place called Golgotha, which means the Place of
   the Skull,

   ^34they offered him a drink of wine mixed with gall, and when he tasted
   it he would not drink it.

   ^35And they crucified him and divided up his clothes among them by
   drawing lots,

   ^36and sat down there to keep watch of him.

   ^37They put above his head the charge against him, which read,

   "This is Jesus, the king of the Jews."

   ^38There were two robbers crucified with him at the time, one at his
   right and one at his left.

   ^39And the passers-by jeered at him, shaking their heads

   ^40and saying,

   "You who would tear down the sanctuary, and build one in three days,
   save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"

   ^41And the high priests, too, made sport of him with the scribes and
   elders, and said,

   ^42"He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is King of Israel;
   let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.

   ^43He trusts in God; let God deliver him if he cares for him, for he
   said he was God's son."

   ^44Even the robbers who were crucified with him abused him in the same
   way.

   ^45Now from noon there was darkness over the whole country until three
   o'clock.

   ^46And about three, Jesus called out loudly,

   "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" that is, "My God! My God! Why have you
   forsaken me?"

   ^47Some of the bystanders when they heard it said,

   "The man is calling for Elijah!"

   ^48And one of them ran off at once and got a sponge and soaked it in
   sour wine and put it on the end of a stick and held it up to him to
   drink.

   ^49But the others said,

   "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."

   ^50But Jesus cried out again loudly, and gave up his spirit.

   ^51And at once the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to
   bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split,

   ^52the tombs opened, and many of the saints who had fallen asleep rose

   ^53and left their tombs and after his resurrection went into the holy
   city and showed themselves to many people.

   ^54And the captain and the men with him who were watching Jesus, when
   they saw the earthquake and all that was happening, were dreadfully
   frightened and said,

   "He surely must have been a son of God!"

   ^55There were several women there watching from a distance who had
   followed Jesus from Galilee to wait upon him,

   ^56among them Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and
   the mother of Zebedee's sons.

   ^57In the evening a rich man named Joseph, from Arimathea, who had
   himself been a disciple of Jesus, came.

   ^58He went to Pilate and asked him for Jesus' body. Then Pilate ordered
   it to be given to him.

   ^59And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a piece of clean linen,

   ^60and laid it in a new tomb that belonged to him, that he had cut in
   the rock, and he rolled a great stone over the doorway of the tomb, and
   went away.

   ^61And Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained there, sitting
   before the tomb.

   ^62On the next day, that is, the day after the Preparation Day, the
   high priests and Pharisees went in a body to Pilate

   ^63and said,

   "Sir, we remember that when this impostor was alive he said, After
   three days I will rise again!'

   ^64Give orders, therefore, to have the tomb closely guarded till the
   third day, so that his disciples cannot come and steal him, and then
   tell the people that he is risen from the dead, and that delusion be
   worse than the other was."

   ^65Pilate said to them,

   "Take a guard of soldiers, and go and make it as secure as you can."

   ^66And they went and set the guard and put a seal on the stone.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 28

   ^1After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary of
   Magdala and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.

   ^2And there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord came down
   from heaven and went and rolled the stone back and sat upon it.

   ^3His appearance was like lightning and his clothing was as white as
   snow.

   ^4The men on guard trembled with fear of him, and became like dead men.

   ^5And the angel said to the women,

   "You need not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was
   crucified.

   ^6He is not here, he has risen, as he said he would do. Come and see
   the place where he was lying.

   ^7Now go quickly and tell his disciples, He has risen from the dead,
   and is going back to Galilee before you. You will see him there.' Now I
   have given you my message."

   ^8And they hurried away from the tomb frightened and yet overjoyed, and
   ran to tell the news to his disciples.

   ^9And Jesus himself met them, and said,

   "Good morning!"

   And they went up to him and clasped his feet, and bowed to the ground
   before him.

   ^10Jesus said to them,

   "You need not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee and
   they will see me there."

   ^11While they were on their way, some of the guard went into the city
   and reported to the high priests all that had happened.

   ^12And they got together and consulted with the elders, and gave the
   soldiers a large sum of money,

   ^13and said to them,

   "Tell people that his disciples came in the night and stole him away
   while you were asleep.

   ^14And if news of it reaches the governor, we will satisfy him, and see
   that you do not get into trouble."

   ^15So they took the money and did as they were told. And this story has
   been current among the Jews ever since.

   ^16And the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain to which
   Jesus had directed them.

   ^17There they saw him and bowed down before him, though some were in
   doubt about it.

   ^18And Jesus came up to them and said, "Full authority in heaven and on
   the earth has been given to me.

   ^19Therefore go and make disciples of all the heathen, baptize them in
   the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit,

   ^20and teach them to observe all the commands that I have given you. I
   will always be with you, to the very close of the age."

  Chapter 1

   ^1The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ.

   ^2As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,

   "Here I send my messenger on before you;

   He will prepare your way;

   ^3Hark! Someone is shouting in the desert,

   Get the Lord's way ready,

   Make his paths straight,' "

   ^4John the baptizer appeared in the desert, and preached repentance and
   baptism in order to obtain the forgiveness of sins.

   ^5And all Judea and everybody in Jerusalem went out to him there, and
   accepted baptism from him in the Jordan River, acknowledging their
   sins.

   ^6John's clothing was made of hair cloth, and the belt around his waist
   was leather, and he lived on dried locusts and wild honey.

   ^7And this was his message:

   "After me there is coming one stronger than I am, one whose shoes I am
   not fit to stoop down and untie.

   ^8I have baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the holy
   Spirit."

   ^9It was in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and
   was baptized by John in the Jordan.

   ^10And just as he was coming up out of the water he saw the heavens
   torn open and the Spirit coming down like a dove to enter into him,

   ^11and out of the heavens came a voice:

   "You are my Son, my Beloved! You are my Chosen!"

   ^12The spirit immediately drove him out into the desert.

   ^13And he remained in the desert for forty days, and Satan tried to
   tempt him there; and he was among the wild animals; but the angels
   waited on him.

   ^14After John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the
   good news from God,

   ^15saying,

   "The time has come and the reign of God is near; repent, and believe
   this good news."

   ^16As he was passing along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw
   Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets in the sea, for they
   were fishermen.

   ^17Jesus said to them,

   "Come, follow me, and I will make you fish for men."

   ^18They immediately abandoned their nets and followed him.

   ^19He went on a little farther and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and
   his brother John; they too were in their boat putting their nets in
   order.

   ^20He immediately called them. And they left their father Zebedee in
   the boat with the hired men and went off after him.

   ^21They proceeded to Capernaum, and on the very first Sabbath he went
   to the synagogue and taught.

   ^22And they were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one
   who had authority, and not like the scribes.

   ^23Just then there was in their synagogue a man under the control of a
   foul spirit, and he cried out,

   ^24"What do you want of us, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to
   destroy us? I know who you are, you are God's holy One!"

   ^25Jesus reproved him, and said,

   "Silence! Get out of him!"

   ^26The foul spirit convulsed the man and gave a loud cry and went out
   of him.

   ^27And they were all so amazed that they discussed it with one another,
   and said,

   "What does this mean? It is a new teaching! He gives orders with
   authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!"

   ^28And his fame immediately spread in all directions through the whole
   neighborhood of Galilee.

   ^29As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to
   the house of Simon and Andrew.

   ^30Simon's mother-in-law was in bed, sick with a fever, and they
   immediately told him about her.

   ^31And he went up to her, and grasping her hand, he made her rise. And
   the fever left her, and she waited on them.

   ^32In the evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick
   or possessed by demons,

   ^33and the whole town was gathered at the door.

   ^34And he cured many who were sick with various diseases, and drove out
   many demons, and he would not let the demons speak, because they knew
   that he was Christ.

   ^35Early in the morning, long before daylight, he got up and left the
   house and went off to a lonely spot, and prayed there.

   ^36And Simon and his companions sought him out

   ^37and found him, and said to him,

   "They are all looking for you!"

   ^38He said to them,

   "Let us go somewhere else, to the neighboring country towns, so that I
   may preach in them, too, for that is why I came out here."

   ^39So he went all through Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and
   driving out the demons.

   ^40There came to him a leper appealing to him on his knees, saying to
   him,

   "If you only choose, you can cure me."

   ^41And he pitied him and stretched out his hand and touched him, and
   said to him,

   "I do choose! Be cured!"

   ^42And the leprosy immediately left him, and he was cured.

   ^43And Jesus immediately drove him away with stern injunctions,

   ^44saying to him,

   "See that you say nothing about this to anybody, but begone! show
   yourself to the priest, and in proof of your cure make the offerings
   for your purification which Moses prescribed."

   ^45But he went off and began to talk so much about it, and to spread
   the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go into a town openly,
   but stayed out in unfrequented places, and people came to him from
   every direction.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1Some days later he came back to Capernaum, and people heard that he
   was at home,

   ^2and such a crowd gathered that after a while there was no room even
   around the door, and he was telling them his message.

   ^3And some people came bringing to him a man who was paralyzed, four of
   them carrying him.

   ^4As they could not get him near Jesus on account of the crowd, they
   broke open the roof just over his head, and through the opening they
   lowered the mat with the paralytic lying on it.

   ^5When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic,

   "My son, your sins are forgiven."

   ^6There were some scribes sitting there pondering and saying to
   themselves,

   ^7"Why does this man talk so? This is blasphemy. Who can forgive sins
   but God alone?"

   ^8Jesus, at once perceiving by his spirit that they were pondering over
   this, said to them,

   "Why do you ponder over this in your minds?

   ^9Which is easier, to say to this paralytic, Your sins are forgiven,'
   or to say to him, "Get up and pick up your mat and walk'?

   ^10But to let you know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive
   sins on earth," turning to the paralytic he said,

   ^11"I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home!"

   ^12And he got up, and immediately picked up his mat and went out before
   them all, so that they were all astonished and acknowledged the power
   of God, saying,

   "We never saw anything like this before."

   ^13He went out of the town again and along the shore, and all the
   people came to him and he taught them.

   ^14And as he was passing along he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus, sitting
   at the tollhouse, and he said to him,

   "Follow me."

   And he got up and followed him.

   ^15He was at table in his house, with many tax-collectors and
   irreligious people who were at table with him and his disciples, for
   there were many of them among his followers.

   ^16And when the scribes who were of the Pharisees' party saw that he
   was eating with irreligious people and tax-collectors, they said to his
   disciples,

   "Why does he eat with tax-collectors and irreligious people?"

   ^17Jesus heard it, and said to them,

   "It is not well people but the sick who have to have the doctor. I did
   not come to invite the pious but the irreligious."

   ^18Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were keeping a fast. And
   people came and asked him,

   "Why is it that when John's disciples and the disciples of the
   Pharisees are keeping the fast, yours are not keeping it?"

   ^19Jesus said to them,

   "Can wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as
   they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.

   ^20But a time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them,
   and when that day comes, they will fast.

   ^21No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old coat; or if he
   does, the patch tears away, the new from the old, and makes the hole
   worse than ever.

   ^22And no one pours new wine into old wine-skins; or if he does, the
   wine bursts the skins, and the wine is lost, and the skins too. New
   wine has to be put into fresh skins."

   ^23He happened to be passing through the wheat fields on the Sabbath,
   and his disciples began to pick the heads of wheat as they made their
   way through.

   ^24And the Pharisees said to him,

   "Look! Why are they doing what it is against the law to do on the
   Sabbath?"

   ^25He said to them,

   "Did you never read what David did, when he was in need and hungry, he
   and his men?

   ^26How is it that he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high
   priest, and ate the Presentation Loaves, which it is against the law
   for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some to his companions
   too?"

   ^27And he said to them,

   "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath,

   ^28and so the Son of Man is master even of the Sabbath."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1He went again to a synagogue, and there was a man there with one hand
   withered.

   ^2And they were watching him closely, to see whether he would cure him
   on the Sabbath, in order to get a charge to bring against him.

   ^3He said to the man with the withered hand,

   "Get up and come forward."

   ^4And he said to them,

   "Is it allowable to do people good on the Sabbath, or to do them harm?
   To save life or kill?" But they made no answer.

   ^5And he looked around at them with anger, hurt by their obstinacy, and
   he said to the man,

   "Hold out your hand!"

   And he held it out, and his hand was cured.

   ^6Then the Pharisees left the synagogue and immediately consulted with
   the Herodians about Jesus, with a view to putting him to death.

   ^7So Jesus retired with his disciples to the seashore, and a great many
   people from Galilee followed him, and from Judea

   ^8and Jerusalem and Idumea and from the other side of the Jordan and
   from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon a great many who had heard of
   the things he was doing came to him.

   ^9He told his disciples to have a boat always ready for his use, to
   prevent his being crushed by the crowd.

   ^10For he cured so many people that all who had any ailments pressed up
   to him to touch him.

   ^11And whenever the foul spirits saw him, they fell down before him and
   screamed out,

   "You are the Son of God!"

   ^12And he warned them repeatedly not to tell who he was.

   ^13And he went up the hillside and summoned to him those whom he
   wanted, and they went to him.

   ^14He appointed twelve of them, whom he called apostles, to be with him
   and to be sent out to preach,

   ^15with power to drive out the demons. These were the twelve he
   appointed:

   ^16Peter, which was the name he gave to Simon,

   ^17James the son of Zebedee, and John, James's brother (he named them
   Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder),

   ^18Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of
   Alpheus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot,

   ^19and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

   Then he went home.

   ^20And again the crowd gathered in such numbers that there was no
   chance for them even to have their meals.

   ^21His relatives heard of it and came over to stop him, for they said
   that he was out of his mind.

   ^22And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said that he was
   possessed by Beelzebub and drove out demons by the help of the prince
   of demons.

   ^23So he called them to him and spoke to them in figures, saying,

   "How can Satan drive Satan out?

   ^24If a kingdom is disunited, that kingdom cannot last.

   ^25And if a household is disunited, that household cannot last.

   ^26And if Satan has rebelled against himself and become disunited, he
   cannot last but is coming to his end.

   ^27But no one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his
   property unless he first binds the strong man; after that he can
   plunder his house.

   ^28I tell you, men will be forgiven for everything, for all their sins
   and all the abusive things they say.

   ^29But whoever reviles the holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but is
   guilty of an unending sin."

   ^30This was because they said, "He is possessed by a foul spirit."

   ^31And his mother and his brothers came. And they stood outside the
   house and sent word in to him to come outside to them.

   ^32There was a crowd sitting around him when they told him,

   "Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you."

   ^33He answered,

   "Who are my mother and my brothers?"

   ^34And looking around at the people sitting about him, he said,

   "Here are my mother and my brothers!

   ^35Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1Then he began again to teach by the seashore. And a crowd gathered
   around him so great that he got into a boat and sat in it, a little way
   from the shore, while all the people were on the land close to the
   water.

   ^2He taught them many lessons in figures, and said to them in the
   course of his teaching,

   ^3"Listen: A sower went out to sow,

   ^4and as he was sowing, some of the seed chanced to fall by the path,
   and the birds came and ate it up.

   ^5Some of it fell on rocky ground, and where there was not much soil,
   and it sprang up at once because the soil was not deep,

   ^6but when the sun came up, it was scorched, and withered up, because
   it had no root.

   ^7Some of the seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and
   choked it out, and it yielded no grain.

   ^8And some fell on good soil, and came up and grew and yielded thirty,
   sixty, even a hundredfold."

   ^9And he said,

   "Let him who has ears be sure to listen!"

   ^10When he was by himself, those who stayed about him with the Twelve
   asked him about the figures he had used.

   ^11And he said to them,

   "To you has been intrusted the secret of the reign of God, but to those
   outsiders, everything is offered in figures,

   ^12so that

   " They may look and look and yet not see,

   And listen and listen and yet not understand,

   Lest possibly they should turn and be forgiven.' ",

   ^13And Jesus said,

   "If you do not understand this figure, then how will you understand my
   other figures?

   ^14What the sower sows is the message.

   ^15The ones by the path are those into whose hearts the message falls,
   and as soon as they hear it Satan comes and carries off the message
   that has been sown in their hearts.

   ^16It is so too with the ones sown on the rocky ground; they gladly
   accept the message as soon as they hear it,

   ^17but it takes no real root in them and they last only a little while;
   then when trouble or persecution comes because of the message they give
   it up at once.

   ^18It is different with those sown among the thorns. They are people
   who listen to the message,

   ^19but the worries of the time and the pleasure of being rich and
   passions for other things creep in and choke the message out and it
   yields nothing.

   ^20And the ones sown in good ground are the people who listen to the
   message and welcome it and yield thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold.

   ^21"Do people get out the lamp," he said to them, "and then put it
   under the peck-measure, or under the bed, instead of putting it up
   where it belongs?

   ^22For no one hides anything except for the purpose of sometime
   bringing it to light again, and people keep things secret only to
   reveal them some day.

   ^23If anyone has ears let him be sure to listen.

   ^24"Take care what you hear," he said to them. "The measure you give
   will be given to you, and even more besides.

   ^25For people who have will have more given them, and from people who
   have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.

   ^26"The reign of God," he said, "is like a man scattering seed on the
   ground,

   ^27and then sleeping at night and getting up by day, while the seed
   sprouts and comes up, without his knowing it.

   ^28The ground of itself is productive, putting forth first a blade,
   then a head, then fully developed wheat in the head.

   ^29But as soon as the crop will let him, the man goes in with his
   sickle, for the harvest time has come.

   ^30"How can we find any comparison," he said, "for the reign of God, or
   what figure can we use to describe it?

   ^31It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown in the ground, though it
   is the smallest of all the seeds in the world,

   ^32yet once sown, comes up and grows to be the largest of all the
   plants, and produces branches so large that the wild birds can roost
   under the shelter of it."

   ^33With many such figures he told them the message, as far as they were
   able to receive it.

   ^34He said nothing to them except in figures, but in private he
   explained everything to his own disciples.

   ^35That same day when it was evening he said to them,

   "Let us cross to the other side."

   ^36So they left the crowd and took him away in the boat in which he was
   sitting. There were other boats with him.

   ^37And a heavy squall of wind came on and the waves dashed into the
   boat, so that it was beginning to fill.

   ^38He was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him up and
   said to him,

   "Master, does it make no difference to you that we are sinking?"

   ^39Then he awoke and reproved the wind, and said to the sea,

   "Hush! Silence!"

   And the wind went down and there was a great calm.

   ^40And he said to them,

   "Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?"

   ^41And they were very much frightened, and said to one another,

   "Who can he be? For even the wind and the sea obey him."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1So they reached the other side of the sea, and landed in the region
   of Gerasa.

   ^2As soon as he got out of the boat, a man possessed by a foul spirit
   came out of the burial places near by to meet him.

   ^3This man lived among the tombs, and no one could any longer secure
   him even with a chain,

   ^4for he had often been fastened with fetters and chains and had
   snapped the chains and broken the fetters; and there was no one strong
   enough to master him,

   ^5and night and day he was always shrieking among the tombs and on the
   hills and cutting himself with stones.

   ^6And catching sight of Jesus in the distance he ran up and made
   obeisance to him

   ^7and screamed out,

   "What do you want of me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? In God's
   name, I implore you, do not torture me."

   ^8For he was saying to him,

   "You foul spirit, come out of this man."

   ^9He asked him,

   "What is your name?"

   He said,

   "My name is Legion, for there are many of us."

   ^10And they begged him earnestly not to send them out of that country.

   ^11Now there was a great drove of pigs feeding there on the hillside.

   ^12And they implored him,

   "Send us among the pigs, let us go into them."

   ^13So he gave them permission. And the foul spirits came out and went
   into the pigs, and the drove of about two thousand rushed over the
   steep bank into the sea, and were drowned.

   ^14And the men who tended them ran away and spread the news in the town
   and in the country around, and the people came to see what had
   happened.

   ^15When they came to Jesus and found the demoniac sitting quietly with
   his clothes on and in his right mind--the same man who had been
   possessed by Legion--they were frightened.

   ^16And those who had seen it told them what had happened to the
   demoniac, and all about the pigs.

   ^17And they began to beg him to leave their district.

   ^18As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed
   begged to be allowed to go with him.

   ^19And he would not permit it, but said to him,

   "Go home to your own people, and tell them all the Lord has done for
   you and how he took pity on you."

   ^20And he went off and began to tell everybody in the Ten Towns all
   Jesus had done for him; and they were all astonished.

   ^21When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great
   crowd gathered about him as he stood on the shore.

   ^22And a man named Jairus, the leader of a synagogue, came up and
   seeing him threw himself at his feet,

   ^23and appealed to him, saying,

   "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come, lay your hands on
   her, so that she may get well and live!"

   ^24So he went with him. And a great crowd followed him and pressed
   around him.

   ^25And a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,

   ^26and had had a great deal of treatment from various doctors and had
   spent all that she had and had not been benefited at all but had
   actually grown worse,

   ^27had heard about Jesus. And she came up in the crowd behind him and
   touched his coat,

   ^28for she said,

   "If I can only touch his clothes, I shall get well."

   ^29The hemorrhage stopped at once, and she felt in her body that she
   was cured.

   ^30Jesus instantly perceived that healing power had passed from him,
   and he turned around in the crowd and said,

   "Who touched my clothes?"

   ^31His disciples said to him,

   "You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you ask, Who touched
   me?' "

   ^32But he still looked around to see the person who had done it.

   ^33The woman, knowing what had happened to her, came forward frightened
   and trembling, and threw herself down at his feet and told him the
   whole truth.

   ^34And he said to her,

   "My daughter, it is your faith that has cured you. Go in peace and be
   free from your disease."

   ^35Even as he spoke people came from the house of the leader of the
   synagogue and said,

   "Your daughter is dead. Why should you trouble the Master any further?"

   ^36But Jesus paid no attention to what they said, but said to the
   leader of the synagogue,

   "Do not be afraid, just have faith."

   ^37He let no one go with him but Peter, James, and James's brother
   John.

   ^38They came to the house of the leader of the synagogue, and there he
   found everything in confusion, and people weeping and wailing.

   ^39And he went into the house and said to them,

   "What is the meaning of all this confusion and crying? The child is not
   dead, she is asleep."

   ^40And they laughed at him. But he drove them all out, and took the
   child's father and mother and the men who were with him and went into
   the room where the child was lying.

   ^41And he grasped her hand and said to her,

   "Taleitha, koum!"--that is to say, "Little girl, I tell you, get up!"

   ^42And the little girl immediately got up and walked about, for she was
   twelve years old. The moment they saw it they were utterly amazed.

   ^43And he strictly forbade them to let anyone know of it, and told them
   to give her something to eat.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1Leaving there he went, followed by his disciples, to his own part of
   the country.

   ^2When the Sabbath came he began to teach in the synagogue. And the
   people were astonished when they heard him, and said,

   "Where did he get all this? How does he come to have such wisdom? How
   are such marvelous things done through him?

   ^3Is he not the carpenter, Mary's son, and the brother of James, Joses,
   Judas, and Simon? And do not his sisters live here among us?"

   ^4And they took offense at him. Jesus said to them,

   "A prophet is treated with honor everywhere except in his native place
   and among his relatives and at his home."

   ^5He could not do any wonder there, except that he put his hands on a
   few sick people and cured them.

   ^6And he wondered at their want of faith.

   Then he went around among the villages teaching.

   ^7And he called the Twelve to him and sent them off two by two, giving
   them power over the foul spirits.

   ^8He forbade them to take anything for the journey except a staff--no
   bread, no bag, no small change even in their girdles;

   ^9they were to go in sandals, and not to wear two shirts.

   ^10And he said to them,

   "Whenever you go to stay at a house, remain in it till you leave that
   place.

   ^11If any place refuses to receive you or to listen to you, when you
   leave it shake off the very dust from the soles of your feet as a
   warning to them."

   ^12So they went out and preached that men should repent,

   ^13and drove out many demons, and cured many sick people by anointing
   them with oil.

   ^14King Herod heard of him, for his name was now well known, and people
   were saying that John the baptizer had risen from the dead, and that
   that was why he was endowed with these extraordinary powers.

   ^15But others said he was Elijah, and still others that he was a
   prophet of the old prophetic kind.

   ^16But when Herod heard of him he said,

   "John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead."

   ^17For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him and put
   him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
   because Herod had married her.

   ^18John said to Herod,

   "It is not right for you to be living with your brother's wife."

   ^19Herodias felt bitterly toward him and wanted him killed. But she
   could not bring it about,

   ^20for Herod stood in awe of John, knowing that he was an upright and
   holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him talk he was very
   much disturbed, and yet he liked to hear him.

   ^21When a holiday came and Herod on his birthday gave a banquet to his
   courtiers and officers and to the leading men of Galilee,

   ^22Herodias' own daughter came in and danced for them. And Herod and
   his guests were delighted, and the king said to the girl,

   ^23"Ask me for anything you like and I will give it to you." And he
   made oath to her,

   "I will give you whatever you ask me for, up to half my kingdom."

   ^24When she had left the room she said to her mother,

   "What shall I ask him for?"

   But she said,

   "The head of John the baptizer."

   ^25And she hurried back at once to the king and asked him for it,
   saying,

   "I want you right away to give me John the Baptist's head on a
   platter."

   ^26The king was exceedingly sorry, but on account of his oath and his
   guests he did not like to break his word to her,

   ^27and he immediately sent one of his guard with orders to get John's
   head.

   ^28And he went off and beheaded him in the prison and brought back his
   head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her
   mother.

   ^29When his disciples heard of it they came and took his body away and
   put it in a tomb.

   ^30The apostles rejoined Jesus and reported to him all they had done
   and taught.

   ^31And he said to them,

   "Come away by yourselves to some quiet place, and rest a little while."

   For people were coming and going in large numbers, and they had no time
   even for meals.

   ^32So they set off by themselves in their boat for a secluded place.

   ^33And many people saw them start and knew of it, and hurried around by
   land from all the neighboring towns, and got ahead of them.

   ^34So when he got out of the boat, he found a great crowd gathered, and
   his heart was touched at the sight of them, because they were like
   sheep that have no shepherd; and he proceeded to teach them a great
   deal.

   ^35When it grew late his disciples came up to him and said,

   "This is a lonely place and it is getting late.

   ^36Send the people off to the farms and villages around to buy
   themselves something to eat."

   ^37But he answered,

   "Give them food yourselves."

   They said to him,

   "Can we go and buy forty dollars' worth of bread and give it to them to
   eat?"

   ^38But he said to them,

   "How many loaves have you? Go and see."

   They looked, and told him.

   "Five, and two fish."

   ^39And he directed them all to sit down in parties on the fresh grass.

   ^40And they threw themselves down in groups, in hundreds and in
   fifties.

   ^41Then he took the five loaves and the two fish and looked up to
   heaven and blessed the loaves and broke them in pieces and gave them to
   the disciples to pass to the people; and he divided the two fish among
   them all.

   ^42And they all ate and had enough.

   ^43And the pieces they gathered up filled twelve baskets, besides the
   pieces of the fish.

   ^44There were five thousand men who ate the loaves.

   ^45He immediately had his disciples get into the boat and cross before
   him to the other side toward Bethsaida, while he was dismissing the
   crowd.

   ^46When he had taken leave of the people he went up the hill to pray.

   ^47When evening came on, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he
   was alone on shore.

   ^48And he saw that they were straining at the oars, for the wind was
   against them, and toward morning he went out to them, walking on the
   sea, and was going to join them.

   ^49They saw him walking on the sea, and thought it was a ghost and
   screamed aloud,

   ^50for they all saw him and were terrified. But he immediately spoke to
   them and said,

   "Take courage, it is I. Do not be afraid."

   ^51Then he went up to them and got into the boat. And the wind fell.
   And they were perfectly beside themselves,

   ^52for they had not understood about the loaves, but their minds were
   blinded.

   ^53They crossed over to the other side and came to Gennesaret and
   moored the boat.

   ^54As soon as they came ashore, the people recognized Jesus,

   ^55and they hurried all over the countryside and began to bring the
   sick to him on their mats, wherever they heard he was.

   ^56And whatever village or town or farm he went to, they would lay
   their sick in the market-place and beg him to let them touch just the
   tassel of his cloak, and all who touched it were cured.

  Chapter 7

   ^1The Pharisees gathered about him with some scribes who had come from
   Jerusalem.

   ^2They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food without
   first giving their hands a ceremonial washing to purify them.

   ^3For the Pharisees and all the Jews observe the rules handed down from
   their ancestors, and will not eat until they have washed their hands in
   a particular way,

   ^4and they will not eat anything from the market without first
   purifying it by sprinkling it, and they have a number of other
   observances which have come down to them, in the way of washing cups,
   pitchers, and basins.

   ^5And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him,

   "Why do your disciples not observe the rules handed down by our
   ancestors, but eat food without purifying their hands?"

   ^6But he said to them,

   "It was about you hypocrites that Isaiah prophesied so finely, in the
   words,

   " This people honor me with their lips,

   Yet their hearts are far away from me.

   ^7But their worship of me is all in vain,

   For the lessons they teach are but human precepts.'

   ^8"You give up what God has commanded and hold fast to what men have
   handed down.

   ^9"How skilful you are," he said to them, "in nullifying what God has
   commanded in order to observe what has been handed down to you.

   ^10For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother,' and again,
   Whoever abuses his father or mother must be put to death.'

   ^11But you say, If a man says to his father or mother, "Anything of
   mine that might have been of use to you is Korban,*#") that is,
   consecrated to God,

   ^12you let him off from doing anything more for his father or mother,

   ^13and so you nullify what God has said by what you have handed down.
   You have many such practices."

   ^14He called the people to him again and said to them,

   "Listen to me, all of you, and understand this.

   ^15Nothing that goes into a man from outside can pollute him. It is
   what comes out of a man that pollutes him."

   ^17When he had left the crowd and gone home, his disciples asked him
   what he meant by this figure.

   ^18And he said to them,

   "Have not even you any understanding then? Do you not see that nothing
   that goes into a man from outside can pollute him,

   ^19since it does not go into his heart but into his stomach and then is
   disposed of?" So he declared all food clean.

   ^20He went on to say,

   "It is what comes out of a man that pollutes him.

   ^21For it is from inside, from men's hearts, that designs of evil come;
   immorality, stealing, murder, adultery,

   ^22greed, malice, deceit, indecency, envy, abusiveness, arrogance,
   folly--

   ^23all these evils come from inside, and they pollute a man."

   ^24He left that place and went to the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon.
   And he went into a certain house, and wanted no one to know of it. And
   he could not keep it secret,

   ^25but a woman whose little daughter was possessed by a foul spirit
   immediately heard about him and came and threw herself at his feet.

   ^26Now the woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician birth. And she begged
   him to drive the demon out of her daughter.

   ^27He said to her,

   "Let the children first eat all they want, for it is not right to take
   the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."

   ^28But she answered,

   "True, sir! and still the dogs under the table eat what the children
   leave!"

   ^29He said to her,

   "If you can say that, go home; the demon has left your daughter."

   ^30And she went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the
   demon gone.

   ^31He left the neighborhood of Tyre again and went by way of Sidon to
   the Sea of Galilee, crossing the district of the Ten Towns.

   ^32And they brought to him a man who was deaf and hardly able to speak,
   and they begged him to lay his hand on him.

   ^33He took him off by himself away from the crowd, and put his fingers
   in the man's ears, and touched his tongue with saliva.

   ^34And he looked up to heaven and sighed, and said to him,

   "Ephphatha!"--which means "Open."

   ^35And his ears were opened and his tongue was released and he talked
   plainly.

   ^36And Jesus forbade them to tell anyone about it, but the more he
   forbade them the more they spread the news far and wide.

   ^37And people were utterly amazed, and said,

   "How well he has done everything! He even makes the deaf hear and the
   dumb speak!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1In those days when a great crowd had gathered again and they had
   nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them,

   ^2"I pity these people, for they have been staying with me three days
   now, and they have nothing left to eat.

   ^3And if I send them home hungry they will give out on the way, for
   some of them come from a distance."

   ^4His disciples replied,

   "Where can anyone get bread enough, here in this solitude, to satisfy
   these people's hunger?"

   ^5"How many loaves have you?" he asked.

   "Seven," they said.

   ^6Then he ordered the people to take their places on the ground. And he
   took the seven loaves and gave thanks and broke them in pieces and gave
   them to his disciples to pass, and they passed them to the people.

   ^7They had a few small fish, and he blessed them and told the disciples
   to pass them also to the people.

   ^8And they ate and satisfied their hunger. And the pieces that they
   left, that were picked up, filled seven baskets.

   ^9There were about four thousand of the people. And he dismissed them.

   ^10Then he immediately got into the boat with his disciples and went to
   the district of Dalmanutha.

   ^11The Pharisees came out and began a discussion with him, testing him
   by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.

   ^12And he sighed deeply and said,

   "Why do the men of this day ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign will be
   given them."

   ^13And he left them and got into the boat again and crossed to the
   other side.

   ^14Now they had forgotten to bring any bread, and they had only one
   loaf with them in the boat.

   ^15And he warned them, saying,

   "Look out! Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the
   yeast of Herod!"

   ^16They were discussing with one another their being without bread.

   ^17And he noticed it and said to them,

   "Why do you discuss your being without bread? Do you not yet see nor
   understand? Are your minds so dull?

   ^18When you have eyes can you not see, and when you have ears can you
   not hear? Do you not remember

   ^19how many baskets of pieces you picked up when I broke the five
   loaves in pieces for those five thousand men?"

   They said to him,

   "Twelve."

   ^20"When I broke the seven loaves in pieces for the four thousand, how
   many baskets of pieces did you pick up?"

   They said to him,

   "Seven."

   ^21He said to them,

   "Do you not understand yet?"

   ^22And they came to Bethsaida. And people brought a blind man to him
   and begged him to touch him.

   ^23He took him by the hand and led him outside of the village, and
   spitting in his eyes he laid his hands on him and asked him,

   "Do you see anything?"

   ^24He looked up and said,

   "I can see people, for they look to me like trees, only they are moving
   about."

   ^25Then he laid his hands on his eyes again, and he looked steadily and
   was cured, and saw everything plainly.

   ^26And he sent him home and said to him,

   "Do not even go into the village."

   ^27Then Jesus and his disciples went away to the villages around
   Caesarea Philippi. On the way he questioned his disciples and said to
   them,

   "Who do people say that I am?"

   ^28They said to him,

   "John the Baptist; others say Elijah, and others that you are one of
   the prophets."

   ^29And he asked them,

   "But who do you say that I am?"

   Peter answered and said to him,

   "You are the Christ."

   ^30And he warned them not to say this about him to anyone.

   ^31Then he explained to them for the first time that the Son of Man
   must go through much suffering, and be refused by the elders and the
   high priests and the scribes, and be killed, and rise again three days
   after.

   ^32He told them this plainly. And Peter took him aside, and began to
   reprove him for it.

   ^33But turning and seeing his disciples he reproved Peter, and said,

   "Get out of my sight, you Satan! for you do not side with God, but with
   men."

   ^34And he called the people and his disciples to him and said to them,

   "If anyone wants to go with me, he must disregard himself, and take his
   cross and follow me.

   ^35For whoever wants to preserve his own life will lose it, and whoever
   loses his life for me and for the good news will preserve it.

   ^36For what good does it do a man to gain the whole world and yet part
   with his life?

   ^37For what can a man give to buy back his life?

   ^38For if anyone is ashamed of me and my teachings in this unfaithful
   and sinful age, then the Son of Man will be ashamed of him, when he
   comes back in his Father's glory, with the holy angels."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   ^1And he said to them, "I tell you, some of you who stand here will
   certainly live to see the reign of God come in its might."

   ^2Six days after this Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him, and
   led them up on a high mountain, off by themselves. And his appearance
   underwent a change in their presence,

   ^3and his clothes shone whiter than any earthly bleaching could make
   them.

   ^4And Elijah appeared to them, accompanied by Moses, and they talked
   with Jesus.

   ^5Then Peter spoke, and said to Jesus,

   "Master, how good it is that we are here! Let us put up three huts, one
   for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."

   ^6For he did not know what to say, they were so frightened.

   ^7And a cloud came and overshadowed them, and from the cloud came a
   voice,

   "This is my Son, my Beloved. Listen to him,"

   ^8And suddenly, on looking around, they saw that there was now no one
   with them but Jesus alone.

   ^9As they were going down the mountain, he cautioned them to let no one
   know what they had seen, until the Son of Man should rise from the
   dead.

   ^10And they did not forget what he said, but discussed with one another
   what he meant by the rising from the dead.

   ^11And they asked him,

   "Why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first?"

   ^12He said to them,

   "Elijah does come first, and reforms everything, and does not the
   Scripture say of the Son of Man that he will suffer much and be
   refused?

   ^13Why, I tell you, not only has Elijah come, but people have treated
   him just as they pleased, as the Scripture says about him."

   ^14When they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them,
   and some scribes arguing with them.

   ^15And all the people were amazed when they saw him, and they ran up to
   him and greeted him.

   ^16And he asked them,

   "What are you discussing with them?"

   ^17One of the crowd answered,

   "Master, I brought my son to you, for he is possessed by a dumb spirit,

   ^18and wherever it seizes him it convulses him, and he foams at the
   mouth and grinds his teeth; and he is wasting away. I told your
   disciples to drive it out, and they could not do it."

   ^19He answered them and said,

   "O you unbelieving people, how long must I be with you? How long must I
   put up with you? Bring him here to me!"

   ^20And they brought the boy to him. As soon as the spirit saw him, it
   convulsed the boy, and he fell down on the ground and rolled about,
   foaming at the mouth.

   ^21Jesus asked the boy's father,

   "How long has he been like this?"

   And he said,

   ^22"From his childhood, and many a time it has thrown him into the fire
   or into the water, to put an end to him. But if there is anything you
   can do, take pity on us and help us!"

   ^23Jesus said to him,

   " If there is anything I can do!' Everything is possible for one who
   has faith!"

   ^24The boy's father immediately cried out,

   "I have faith! Help my want of faith!"

   ^25Then Jesus, seeing that a crowd was rapidly gathering, reproved the
   foul spirit and said to it,

   "You deaf and dumb spirit, get out of him, I charge you, and never
   enter him again!"

   ^26And it gave a cry and convulsed him terribly, and went out of him.

   And the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was
   dead.

   ^27But Jesus grasped his hand and made him rise, and he stood up.

   ^28When he had gone home, and his disciples were alone with him, they
   asked him,

   "Why could not we drive it out?"

   ^29He said to them,

   "This kind of thing can be driven out only by prayer."

   ^30And they left that place and made their way through Galilee, and he
   did not wish anyone to know it;

   ^31for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them,

   "The Son of Man is to be handed over to men, and they will kill him,
   and three days after he is killed he will rise again."

   ^32But they did not understand what he meant, and they were afraid to
   ask him about it.

   ^33And they reached Capernaum. When he reached home, he asked them,

   "What was it that you were discussing on the way?"

   ^34But they made no answer, for on the way they had been discussing
   with one another which of them was the greatest.

   ^35And he sat down and called the Twelve in, and said to them,

   "If anyone wishes to be first, he must be the last of all and the
   servant of all."

   ^36And he took a child and made him stand among them, and he put his
   arms around him, and said to them,

   ^37"Whoever welcomes one child like this on my account is welcoming me,
   and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but him who has sent me."

   ^38John said to him,

   "Master, we saw a man driving out demons with your name, and we told
   him not to do so, for he was not one of our followers."

   ^39But Jesus said,

   "Do not tell him not to do so, for there is no one who will use my name
   to do a mighty act, and be able soon after to abuse me.

   ^40For the man who is not against us is for us.

   ^41For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink, on the ground that
   you belong to Christ, I tell you, will certainly not fail to be repaid.

   ^42And whoever causes one of these humble believers to fall might
   better have a great millstone hung around his neck and be thrown into
   the sea.

   ^43If your hand makes you fall, cut it off. You might better enter upon
   life maimed, than go with both your hands to the pit, into the fire
   that cannot be put out.

   ^45And if your foot makes you fall, cut it off. You might better enter
   upon life crippled, than be thrown with both your feet into the pit.

   ^47And if your eye makes you fall, tear it out. You might better get
   into the Kingdom of God with only one eye than be thrown with both your
   eyes into the pit,

   ^48where the worm that feeds upon them never dies and the fire is never
   put out.

   ^49Everyone must be seasoned with fire.

   ^50Salt is a good thing, but if salt loses its strength, what will you
   use to season it? You must have salt within you, and live in peace with
   one another."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1And he left that place and went into the district of Judea and
   crossed the Jordan, and crowds of people again gathered about him, and
   again he taught them as he was accustomed to do.

   ^2Some Pharisees came up, and in order to test him asked him whether a
   man should be allowed to divorce his wife.

   ^3But he answered,

   "What has Moses commanded you to do?"

   ^4They said,

   "Moses permits a man to divorce his wife by drawing up a written
   divorce-notice."

   ^5But Jesus said to them,

   "It was on account of your perversity that he laid down that law for
   you.

   ^6But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and
   female.

   ^7Therefore a man must leave his father and mother, and he and his wife
   must become one,'

   ^8and so they are no longer two but one.

   ^9Therefore what God has joined together man must not try to separate."

   ^10When they reached the house the disciples asked him about this
   again.

   ^11And he said to them,

   "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits
   adultery against his former wife,

   ^12and if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she is
   an adulteress."

   ^13And people brought children to him to have him touch them, but the
   disciples reproved them for it.

   ^14When Jesus saw it, he was indignant, and said to them,

   "Let the children come to me; do not try to stop them, for the Kingdom
   of God belongs to such as they.

   ^15I tell you, whoever does not accept the Kingdom of God like a child
   shall not enter it at all."

   ^16And he took the children in his arms and laid his hands on them and
   blessed them.

   ^17As he was starting again on his journey, a man came running up to
   him, and knelt at his feet and asked him,

   "Good master, what must I do to make sure of eternal life?"

   ^18But Jesus said to him,

   "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God himself.

   ^19You know the commandments--Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do
   not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father
   and mother.'

   ^20But he said to him,

   "Master, I have obeyed all these commandments ever since I was a
   child."

   ^21And Jesus looked at him and loved him, and he said to him,

   "There is one thing that you lack. Go, sell all you have, and give the
   money to the poor, and then you will have riches in heaven; and come
   back and be a follower of mine."

   ^22But his face fell at Jesus' words, and he went away much cast down,
   for he had a great deal of property.

   ^23And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,

   "How hard it will be for those who have money to enter the Kingdom of
   God!"

   ^24But the disciples were amazed at what he said. And Jesus said to
   them again,

   "My children, how hard it is to enter the Kingdom of God!

   ^25It is easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for
   a rich man to get into the Kingdom of God!"

   ^26They were perfectly astounded and said to him,

   "Then who can be saved?"

   ^27Jesus looked at them and said,

   "For men it is impossible, but not for God, for anything is possible
   for God."

   ^28Peter started to say to him,

   "Well, we have left all we had, and have followed you."

   ^29Jesus said,

   "I tell you, there is no one who has given up home or brothers or
   sisters or mother or father or children or land for me and for the good
   news,

   ^30but will receive now in this life a hundred times as much in homes,
   brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and lands, though not without
   persecution--and in the coming age eternal life.

   ^31But many who are first now will be last then, and the last will be
   first."

   ^32As they went on their way up to Jerusalem, Jesus walked ahead of
   them, and they were in dismay, and those who still followed were
   afraid. And he took the Twelve aside again and began to tell them what
   was going to happen to him.

   ^33"See!" he said, "we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man
   will be handed over to the high priests and scribes, and they will
   condemn him to death and hand him over to the heathen

   ^34and they will ridicule him and spit on him and flog him and kill
   him; and three days after he will rise again."

   ^35And Zebedee's two sons, James and John, came up to him and said,

   "Master, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."

   ^36He said to them,

   "What do you want me to do for you?"

   ^37They said to him,

   "Let us sit one at your right hand and one at your left, in your
   triumph."

   ^38Jesus said to them,

   "You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink what I am
   drinking, or undergo the baptism that I am undergoing?"

   ^39They said to him,

   "Yes, we can."

   Jesus said to them,

   "Then you shall drink what I am drinking, and you shall undergo the
   baptism that I am undergoing;

   ^40but as for sitting at my right or at my left, that is not mine to
   give, but belongs to those for whom it is destined."

   ^41When the other ten heard of this they were at first very indignant
   at James and John.

   ^42And Jesus called them to him, and said to them,

   "You know that those who are supposed to rule the heathen lord it over
   them, and their great men tyrannize over them;

   ^43but it is not to be so among you. Whoever wants to be great among
   you must be your servant,

   ^44and whoever wants to hold the first place among you must be
   everybody's slave.

   ^45For the Son of Man himself has not come to be waited on, but to wait
   on other people, and to give his life to free many others."

   ^46And they came to Jericho. As he was leaving the town with his
   disciples and a great crowd, Timaeus' son Bartimaeus, a blind beggar,
   was sitting at the roadside.

   ^47When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out,

   "Jesus, you son of David, take pity on me!"

   ^48Many of the people rebuked him and told him to be still. But he
   cried out all the louder,

   "You son of David, take pity on me!"

   ^49Jesus stopped and said,

   "Call him here."

   And they called the blind man and said to him,

   "Courage now! Get up, he is calling you!"

   ^50And he threw off his coat and sprang to his feet and went up to
   Jesus.

   ^51Jesus spoke to him and said,

   "What do you want me to do for you?"

   The blind man said to him,

   "Master, let me regain my sight!"

   ^52Jesus said to him,

   "Go your way. Your faith has cured you."

   And he immediately regained his sight and followed Jesus along the
   road.

  Chapter 11

   ^1When they were getting near Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage and
   Bethany near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on
   ahead,

   ^2and said to them,

   "Go to the village that lies in front of you, and as soon as you enter
   it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it
   and bring it here.

   ^3And if anybody says to you, Why are you doing that?' say, The Master
   needs it, and will send it back here directly.' "

   ^4And they set off and found a colt tied in the street at the door of a
   house, and they untied it.

   ^5Some of the bystanders said to them,

   "What are you doing, untying the colt?"

   ^6But they answered them as Jesus had told them to do, and the men let
   them take it.

   ^7So they brought the colt to Jesus, and they threw their coats over it
   and Jesus mounted it.

   ^8And many of the people spread their coats in the road, and others cut
   straw from the fields and scattered it in his path.

   ^9And those in front and those behind shouted,

   "God bless him!

   Blessed be he who comes in the Lord's name!

   ^10Blessed be the reign of our father David which is coming!

   God bless him from on high!"

   ^11And he came into Jerusalem and into the Temple, and looked it all
   over; then, as it was already late, he went out with the Twelve to
   Bethany.

   ^12On the next day, after they had left Bethany, he felt hungry.

   ^13And he saw in the distance a fig tree covered with leaves, and he
   went up to it to see if he could find any figs on it. When he reached
   it he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the time for figs.

   ^14And he spoke to the tree and said to it,

   "May no one ever eat fruit from you any more!"

   And his disciples heard it.

   ^15When they reached Jerusalem, he went into the Temple, and began to
   drive out of it those who were buying or selling things in it, and he
   upset the money-changers' tables and the pigeon-dealers' seats,

   ^16and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the Temple.

   ^17And he taught them, and said,

   "Does not the Scripture say, My house shall be called a house of prayer
   for all the nations'? But you have made it a robbers' cave."

   ^18The high priests and the scribes heard of this, and they cast about
   for a way of destroying him, for they were afraid of him, for all the
   people were amazed at what he taught.

   ^19So when evening came, he and his disciples used to go out of the
   city.

   ^20In the morning as they were passing along, they saw that the fig
   tree was withered, to its very roots.

   ^21And Peter remembered about it and said to him,

   "Look, Master! The fig tree that you cursed is withered up!"

   ^22Jesus answered and said to them,

   "Have faith in God!

   ^23I tell you, whoever says to this mountain, Get up and throw yourself
   into the sea!' and has no doubt in his mind, but has faith that what he
   says will happen, shall have it.

   ^24Therefore I tell you, whenever you pray or ask for anything, have
   faith that it has been granted you, and you shall have it.

   ^25And whenever you stand up to pray, if you have a grievance against
   anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven too may forgive you
   your offenses."

   ^27Then they went into Jerusalem again. And as Jesus was walking about
   in the Temple, the high priests, scribes, and elders came up

   ^28and said to him,

   "What authority have you for doing as you do? And who gave you a right
   to do as you are doing?"

   ^29Jesus said to them,

   "Let me ask you one question, and if you answer me, I will tell you
   what authority I have for doing as I do.

   ^30Was John's baptism from heaven or from men? Answer me."

   ^31And they argued with one another,

   "If we say, It was from heaven,' he will say, Then why did you not
   believe him?'

   ^32Yet can we say, It was from men'?" For they were afraid of the
   people, because all the people thought John was really a prophet.

   ^33So they answered Jesus,

   "We do not know."

   Jesus said to them,

   "Nor will I tell you what authority I have for doing as I do."

  Chapter 12

   ^1Then he began to speak to them in figures.

   "A man once planted a vineyard and fenced it in and hewed out a
   wine-vat and built a watch tower, and he leased it to tenants and left
   the neighborhood.

   ^2At the proper time he sent a slave to the tenants to get from them a
   share of the vintage.

   ^3And they took him and beat him and sent him back empty-handed.

   ^4And again he sent another slave to them. And they beat him over the
   head and treated him shamefully.

   ^5And he sent another; and him they killed; and so with many others,
   some they beat and some they killed.

   ^6He still had one left to send, a dearly loved son. He sent him to
   them last of all, thinking, They will respect my son.'

   ^7But the tenants said to one another, This is his heir! Come on, let
   us kill him, and the property will belong to us!'

   ^8So they took him and killed him, and threw his body outside of the
   vineyard.

   ^9What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come back and put the
   tenants to death and give the vineyard to others.

   ^10Did you never read this passage of Scripture:

   " That stone which the builders rejected

   Has become the cornerstone;

   ^11This came from the Lord

   And seems marvelous to us'?"

   ^12And they tried to have him arrested, but they were afraid of the
   people, for they knew that the illustration was aimed at them. And they
   left him and went away.

   ^13They sent some Pharisees and Herodians to him to entrap him in
   argument.

   ^14And they came up and said to him,

   "Master, we know that you tell the truth regardless of the
   consequences, for you are not guided by personal considerations, but
   teach the way of God with sincerity. Is it right to pay the poll tax to
   the emperor or not?

   ^15Should we pay it, or refuse to pay it?"

   But he saw through their pretense, and said to them,

   "Why do you put me to such a test? Bring me a denarius to look at."

   ^16And they brought him one. He said to them,

   "Whose head and title is this?"

   And they told him,

   "The emperor's."

   ^17And Jesus said,

   "Pay the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and pay God what belongs
   to God!"

   And they were astonished at him.

   ^18Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him
   and asked him a question.

   ^19"Master," they said, "Moses made us a law that if a man's brother
   died, leaving a wife but no child, the man should marry the widow and
   raise up a family for his brother.

   ^20There were once seven brothers. And the eldest married a wife and
   died, leaving no child.

   ^21And the second married her, and died without leaving any child, and
   so did the third.

   ^22And none of the seven left any child. Finally, the woman died too.

   ^23At the resurrection, which one's wife will she be? For all seven of
   them married her."

   ^24Jesus said to them,

   "Does not this show that you are wrong, and do not understand either
   the Scriptures or the power of God?

   ^25For when people rise from the dead, there is no marrying or being
   married, but they live as angels do in heaven.

   ^26But as to the dead being raised, have you never read in the Book of
   Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, I am the God
   of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?

   ^27He is not God of dead men but of living! You are entirely wrong."

   ^28One of the scribes came up and heard them arguing. He saw that Jesus
   had answered them well, and he asked him,

   "Which is the first of all the commands?"

   ^29Jesus answered,

   "The first one is, Hear, Israel! The Lord our God is one lord,

   ^30and you must love the Lord your God with your whole heart, your
   whole soul, your whole mind, and your whole strength.'

   ^31And this is the second: You must love your neighbor as you do
   yourself.' No other command is greater than these."

   ^32The scribe said to him,

   "Really, Master, you have finely said that he stands alone, and there
   is none but he,

   ^33and to love him with one's whole heart, one's whole understanding,
   and one's whole strength, and to love one's neighbor as one's self is
   far more than all these burnt-offerings and sacrifices."

   ^34And Jesus saw that he answered thoughtfully, and he said to him,

   "You are not far from the Kingdom of God!"

   And no one ventured to ask him any more questions.

   ^35As Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he answered them and said,

   "How can the scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?

   ^36David himself, under the influence of the holy Spirit, said,

   " The Lord has said to my lord, "Sit at my right hand

   Until I put your enemies under your feet.*#")

   ^37David himself calls him lord, and how can he be his son?"

   The mass of the people liked to hear him.

   ^38And in the course of his teaching he said to them,

   "Beware of the scribes who like to go about in long robes and to be
   saluted with respect in public places,

   ^39and to have the front seats in the synagogues and the best places at
   dinners--

   ^40men that eat up widows' houses and to cover it up make long prayers!
   They will get a far heavier sentence!"

   ^41And he sat down facing the treasury and watched the people dropping
   money into it; and many rich people were putting in large sums.

   ^42A poor widow came up and dropped in two little copper coins which
   make a cent.

   ^43And he called his disciples to him and said,

   "I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all these others
   who have been putting money into the treasury.

   ^44For they all gave of what they had to spare, but she in her want has
   put in everything she possessed--all she had to live on."

  Chapter 13

   ^1As he was leaving the Temple, one of his disciples said to him,

   "Look, Master! What wonderful stones and buildings!"

   ^2Jesus said to him,

   "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left here
   upon another that shall not be torn down."

   ^3As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Temple, Peter,
   James, John, and Andrew asked him, apart from the others,

   ^4"Tell us when this is to happen, and what the sign will be when it is
   all just going to be carried out."

   ^5And Jesus said to them,

   "Take care that no one misleads you about this.

   ^6Many will come under my name and say I am he,' and many will be
   misled by them.

   ^7But when you hear of wars and rumors of war, you must not be alarmed.
   They have to come, but it is not yet the end.

   ^8For nation will rise in arms against nation and kingdom against
   kingdom; there will be earthquakes here and there, there will be
   famines. This is only the beginning of the sufferings.

   ^9But you must be on your guard; they will hand you over to courts and
   you will be taken into synagogues and beaten, and you will be brought
   before governors and kings on my account, to testify to them.

   ^10For before the end the good news must be preached to all the
   heathen.

   ^11When they are taking you off to trial do not worry beforehand about
   what you ought to say, but say whatever is given you when the time
   comes, for it is not you that will speak, but the holy Spirit.

   ^12Brother will give up brother to be put to death, and the father his
   child, and children will turn against their parents and have them put
   to death.

   ^13You will be hated by everyone, because you bear my name. But he who
   holds out to the end will be saved.

   ^14But as soon as you see the dreadful desecration standing where he
   has no right to stand" (the reader must take note of this), "then those
   who are in Judea must fly to the hills;

   ^15a man on the roof of his house must not go down or go into the house
   to get anything out of it,

   ^16and a man in the field must not turn back to get his coat.

   ^17Alas for women who are with child at that time, or who have babies!

   ^18Pray that it may not be winter when it comes,

   ^19for there will be such misery in those days as there has never been
   since the beginning of God's creation until now, and never will be
   again.

   ^20If the Lord had not cut those days short, nobody would have escaped,
   but for the sake of his own chosen people he has cut the days short.

   ^21If anyone says to you at that time, Look! Here is the Christ!' or
   Look! There he is!' do not believe it.

   ^22For false Christs and false prophets will appear, and they will show
   signs and wonders to mislead God's chosen people if they can.

   ^23But you must be on your guard; I have told you all about it
   beforehand.

   ^24But in those days, when that misery is over, the sun will be
   darkened and the moon will not shed its light

   ^25and the stars will fall from the sky and the forces in the sky will
   shake.

   ^26Then they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds with great
   power and glory,

   ^27and then he will send out the angels and gather his chosen people
   from the four winds, from one end of the world to the other.

   ^28"Let the fig tree teach you the lesson. As soon as its branches grow
   soft and put forth leaves you know that summer is coming.

   ^29So when you see these things happening, you must know that he is
   just at the door.

   ^30I tell you, these things will all happen before the present age
   passes away.

   ^31Earth and sky will pass away, but my words will not.

   ^32But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in
   heaven, nor the Son; only the Father.

   ^33You must look out and be on the alert, for you do not know when it
   will be time;

   ^34just as a man when he leaves home to go on a journey, and puts his
   slaves in charge, each with his duties, gives orders to the watchman to
   keep watch.

   ^35So you must be on the watch, for you do not know when the master of
   the house is coming--in the evening or at midnight or toward daybreak
   or early in the morning--

   ^36for fear he should come unexpectedly and find you asleep.

   ^37And what I am telling you I mean for all--Be on the watch!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   ^1It was now two days before the festival of the Passover and of
   Unleavened Bread. And the high priests and scribes were casting about
   for a way to arrest him by stealth and put him to death,

   ^2for they said,

   "It must not be during the festival, or there may be a riot."

   ^3Jesus was in Bethany, at the house of Simon the leper, and as he was
   at table, a woman came in, with an alabaster flask of pure nard
   perfume, very expensive; she broke the flask and poured the perfume on
   his head.

   ^4But there were some who said indignantly to themselves,

   "What was the use of wasting the perfume like that?

   ^5It might have been sold for more than sixty dollars, and the money
   have been given to the poor."

   ^6And they grumbled at her. But Jesus said,

   "Leave her alone. Why do you bother her? It is a fine thing that she
   has done to me.

   ^7For you always have the poor among you, and whenever you please you
   can do for them, but you will not always have me.

   ^8She has done all she could; she has perfumed my body in preparation
   for my burial.

   ^9I tell you, wherever the good news is preached all over the world,
   what she has done will also be told in memory of her."

   ^10Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the high priests to
   betray Jesus to them.

   ^11They were delighted to hear it and promised to pay him for it. So he
   was watching for an opportunity to betray him to them.

   ^12On the first day of the festival of Unleavened Bread, on which it
   was customary to kill the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples said to him,

   "Where do you wish us to go and make the preparations for you to eat
   the Passover supper?"

   ^13So he sent away two of his disciples, saying to them,

   "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water.
   Follow him,

   ^14and whatever house he goes into, say to the man of the house, The
   Master says, "Where is my room where I can eat the Passover supper with
   my disciples?" '

   ^15And he will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready.
   Make your preparations for us there."

   ^16So the disciples started and went into the city, and found
   everything just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover
   supper.

   ^17When it was evening he came with the Twelve.

   ^18And when they were at the table eating, Jesus said,

   "I tell you, one of you is going to betray me--one who is eating with
   me."

   ^19And they were hurt, and said to him one after another,

   "Can it be I?"

   ^20He said to them,

   "It is one of the Twelve, who is dipping his bread in the same dish
   with me.

   ^21For the Son of Man is indeed to go away as the Scriptures say of
   him, but alas for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would
   have been better for that man if he had never been born."

   ^22As they were eating, he took a loaf and blessed it, and he broke it
   in pieces and gave it to them saying,

   "Take this. It is my body."

   ^23And he took the wine cup and gave thanks and gave it to them and
   they all drank from it.

   ^24And he said to them,

   "This is my blood which ratifies the agreement, and is to be poured out
   for many people.

   ^25I tell you, I will never drink the product of the vine again till
   the day when I shall drink the new wine in the Kingdom of God."

   ^26After singing the hymn they went out of the city and up the Mount of
   Olives.

   ^27And Jesus said to them,

   "You will all desert me, for the Scriptures say, I will strike the
   shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'

   ^28But after I am raised to life again I will go back to Galilee before
   you."

   ^29But Peter said to him,

   "Even if they all desert you, I will not!"

   ^30Jesus said to him,

   "I tell you, this very night before the cock crows twice you yourself
   will disown me three times!"

   ^31But he persisted vehemently,

   "If I have to die with you, I will never disown you."

   And they all said the same thing.

   ^32They came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his
   disciples,

   "Sit down here while I pray."

   ^33And he took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to
   feel distress and dread,

   ^34and he said to them,

   "My heart is almost breaking. You must stay here and keep watch."

   ^35And he went on a little way and threw himself on the ground and
   prayed that if it were possible he might be spared the hour of trial,

   ^36and he said,

   "Abba!" that is, Father, "anything is possible for you! Take this cup
   away from me! Yet not what I please but what you do!"

   ^37When he went back he found them asleep and he said to Peter,

   "Simon, are you asleep? Were you not able to watch for one hour?

   ^38You must all watch, and pray that you may not be subjected to trial.
   One's spirit is eager, but human nature is weak."

   ^39He went away again and prayed in the same words as before.

   ^40When he came back he found them asleep again, for they could hardly
   keep their eyes open; and they did not know what answer to make to him.

   ^41When he came back for the third time, he said to them,

   "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough of this! The time
   has come. See! the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of wicked men.

   ^42Get up, let us be going. Look, here comes my betrayer!"

   ^43Just at that moment, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one
   of the Twelve, came up, and with him a crowd of men with swords and
   clubs, from the high priests, scribes, and elders.

   ^44Now the man who betrayed him had given them a signal, saying,

   "The one I kiss is the man. Seize him and take him safely away."

   ^45So when he came he went straight up to Jesus and said, "Master!" and
   kissed him affectionately.

   ^46And they laid hands on him and seized him.

   ^47But one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck at the high
   priest's slave and cut his ear off.

   ^48And Jesus spoke and said to them,

   "Have you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs, as though I were
   a robber?

   ^49I have been among you day after day in the Temple teaching, and you
   never seized me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled!"

   ^50Then all the disciples left him and made their escape.

   ^51And a young man followed him with nothing but a linen cloth about
   his body; and they seized him,

   ^52but he left the cloth behind and ran away naked.

   ^53They took Jesus away to the high priest, and all the high priests,
   elders, and scribes came together.

   ^54And Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of
   the high priest and sat down with the attendants and warmed himself at
   the fire.

   ^55The high priests and the whole council tried to get evidence against
   Jesus in order to put him to death, and they could find none,

   ^56for while many gave false testimony against him their evidence did
   not agree.

   ^57Some got up and gave false testimony against him to this effect:

   ^58"We ourselves have heard him say, I will tear down this sanctuary
   built by men's hands, and in three days I will build another, made
   without hands.' "

   ^59And even then their evidence did not agree.

   ^60Then the high priest got up and came forward into the center and
   asked Jesus,

   "Have you no answer to make? What about their evidence against you?"

   ^61But Jesus was silent and made no answer. The high priest again
   questioned him and said to him,

   "Are you the Christ, the son of the Blessed One?"

   ^62But Jesus said,

   "I am! and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the
   Almighty and coming in the clouds of the sky!"

   ^63Then the high priest tore his clothing, and said,

   "What do we want of witnesses now?

   ^64Did you hear his blasphemy? What is your decision?"

   And they all condemned him as deserving to be put to death.

   ^65And some started to spit at him and to blindfold him and strike him,
   and say to him,

   "Now show that you are a prophet!"

   And the attendants slapped him as they took charge of him.

   ^66While Peter was down in the courtyard, one of the high priest's
   maids came up,

   ^67and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said,

   "You were with this Jesus of Nazareth too!"

   ^68But he denied it, saying,

   "I do not know or understand what you mean."

   He went out into the gateway.

   ^69And the maid saw him there and began again to tell the bystanders,

   "This fellow is one of them!"

   ^70But he denied it again. And again a little while after, the
   bystanders said to Peter,

   "You certainly are one of them, for you are a Galilean!"

   ^71But he began to swear with the strongest oaths,

   "I do not know this man that you are talking about!"

   ^72At that moment for the second time a cock crowed. And Peter
   remembered how Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows twice, you
   will disown me three times!" And at that, he wept aloud.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   ^1As soon as it was daylight, the high priests held a consultation with
   the elders and scribes, and they and the whole council bound Jesus and
   took him away and handed him over to Pilate.

   ^2Pilate asked him,

   "Are you the king of the Jews?"

   He answered,

   "Yes."

   ^3And the high priests kept heaping accusations upon him.

   ^4But Pilate again asked him,

   "Have you no answer to make? See what charges they are making against
   you."

   ^5But Jesus made no further answer at all, so that Pilate wondered.

   ^6Now at festival time he used to set free for them one prisoner, whom
   they petitioned for.

   ^7There was in prison a man called Barabbas, among some revolutionaries
   who in their outbreak had committed murder.

   ^8And a crowd of people came up and started to ask him for the usual
   favor.

   ^9Pilate asked them,

   "Do you want me to set the king of the Jews free for you?"

   ^10For he knew that the high priests had handed him over to him out of
   envy.

   ^11But the high priests stirred up the crowd to get him to set Barabbas
   free for them instead.

   ^12And Pilate again said to them,

   "Then what shall I do with the man you call the king of the Jews?"

   ^13They shouted back,

   "Crucify him!"

   ^14And Pilate said to them,

   "Why, what has he done that is wrong?"

   But they shouted all the louder,

   "Crucify him!"

   ^15And as Pilate wanted to satisfy the crowd, he set Barabbas free for
   them, and after having Jesus flogged handed him over to be crucified.

   ^16Then the soldiers took him inside the courtyard, that is, of the
   governor's residence, and they called the whole battalion together.

   ^17And they dressed him up in a purple cloak, and made a wreath of
   thorns and crowned him with it,

   ^18and they began to acclaim him,

   "Long live the king of the Jews!"

   ^19And they struck him on the head with a stick and spat at him, and
   they knelt down and did homage to him.

   ^20When they had finished making sport of him, they took off the purple
   cloak and put his own clothes on him.

   Then they took him out of the city to crucify him.

   ^21And they forced a passer-by, who was coming in from the country, to
   carry his cross--one Simon, a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and
   Rufus.

   ^22And they took him to the place called Golgotha, which means the
   Place of the Skull.

   ^23They offered him drugged wine, but he would not take it.

   ^24Then they crucified him, and divided up his clothes, drawing lots
   for them to see what each of them should have.

   ^25It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.

   ^26And the notice of the charge against him read, "The king of the
   Jews."

   ^27They crucified two robbers along with him, one at his right and one
   at his left.

   ^29And the passers-by jeered at him, shaking their heads and saying,

   "Aha! you who would tear down the sanctuary and build one in three
   days!

   ^30Come down from the cross and save yourself!"

   ^31The high priests too made sport of him to one another with the
   scribes and said,

   "He saved others, but he cannot save himself!

   ^32Let this Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now,
   so that we may see it and believe!" And the men who were crucified with
   him abused him.

   ^33At noon darkness spread over the whole country, and lasted until
   three in the afternoon.

   ^34And at three o'clock Jesus called out loudly,

   "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have
   you forsaken me?"

   ^35Some of the bystanders, when they heard it, said,

   "See! He is calling for Elijah!"

   ^36One man ran off and soaked a sponge in common wine, and put it on
   the end of a stick and held it up to him to drink, saying,

   "Let us see whether Elijah does come to take him down!"

   ^37But Jesus gave a loud cry, and expired.

   ^38And the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two, from top to
   bottom.

   ^39And when the captain who stood facing him saw how he expired he
   said,

   "This man was certainly a son of God!"

   ^40There were some women also watching from a distance, among them Mary
   of Magdala, Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and
   Salome,

   ^41who used to accompany him and wait on him when he was in
   Galilee--besides many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with
   him.

   ^42Although it was now evening, yet since it was the Preparation Day,
   that is, the day before the Sabbath,

   ^43Joseph of Arimathea, a highly respected member of the council, who
   was himself living in expectation of the reign of God, made bold to go
   to Pilate and ask for Jesus' body.

   ^44Pilate wondered whether he was dead already, and he sent for the
   captain and asked whether he was dead yet,

   ^45and when he learned from the captain that he was, he gave Joseph
   permission to take the body.

   ^46And he bought a linen sheet and took him down from the cross and
   wrapped him in the sheet, and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out
   of the rock, and rolled a stone against the doorway of the tomb.

   ^47And Mary of Magdala and Mary, Joses' mother, were looking on and saw
   where he was put.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   ^1When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary, James's mother, and
   Salome bought spices, in order to go and anoint him.

   ^2Then very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb,
   when the sun had just risen.

   ^3And they said to one another,

   "Who will roll the stone back from the doorway of the tomb for us?"

   ^4And they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled back, for
   it was very large.

   ^5And when they went into the tomb they saw a young man in a white robe
   sitting at the right, and they were utterly amazed.

   ^6But he said to them,

   "You must not be amazed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was
   crucified. He has risen, he is not here. See! This is where they laid
   him.

   ^7But go and say to his disciples and to Peter, He is going before you
   to Galilee; you will see him there, just as he told you.' "

   ^8And they fled out of the tomb, for they were all trembling and
   bewildered, and they said nothing about it to anyone, for they were
   afraid to do so.

   ^9Now after he had risen, early on the first day of the week, he
   appeared first to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven
   evil spirits.

   ^10She went and told it to his old companions, while they were mourning
   and weeping.

   ^11When they heard that he was alive and that she had seen him, they
   would not believe it.

   ^12Afterward he showed himself in a different form to two of them as
   they were walking along, on their way into the country.

   ^13They went back and told the rest, but they would not believe them.

   ^14Still later he appeared to the Eleven themselves when they were at
   table, and reproached them for their obstinacy and want of faith,
   because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had been
   raised from the dead.

   ^15And he said to them,

   "Go to the whole world and proclaim the good news to all the creation.

   ^16He who believes it and is baptized will be saved, but he who does
   not believe it will be condemned.

   ^17And signs like these will attend those who believe: with my name
   they will drive out demons; they will speak in foreign tongues;

   ^18they will take snakes in their hands, and if they drink poison it
   will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they
   will get well."

   ^19So the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was caught up into
   heaven and took his seat at God's right hand.

   ^20And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked
   with them and confirmed their message by the signs that attended it.

The Gospel According to Luke
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Many writers have undertaken to compose accounts of the movement
   which has developed among us,

   ^2just as the original eye-witnesses who became teachers of the message
   have handed it down to us.

   ^3For that reason, Theophilus, and because I have investigated it all
   carefully from the beginning, I have determined to write a connected
   account of it for Your Excellency,

   ^4so that you may be reliably informed about the things you have been
   taught.

   ^5In the days when Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named
   Zechariah who belonged to the division of Abijah. His wife was also a
   descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

   ^6They were both upright in the sight of God, blamelessly observing all
   the Lord's commands and requirements.

   ^7They had no children, for Elizabeth was barren; and they were both
   advanced in life.

   ^8Once when he was acting as priest before God, when his division was
   on duty,

   ^9 it fell to his lot, according to the priests' practice, to go into
   the sanctuary of the Lord and burn the incense,

   ^10while all the throng of people was outside, praying at the hour of
   the incense offering.

   ^11And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right of
   the altar of incense.

   ^12When Zechariah saw him he was startled and overcome with fear.

   ^13And the angel said to him,

   "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard. Your wife
   Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.

   ^14This will bring gladness and delight to you, and many will rejoice
   over his birth.

   ^15For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will drink no wine
   or strong drink, but he will be filled with the holy Spirit from his
   very birth,

   ^16and he will turn many of Israel's descendants to the Lord their God.

   ^17He will go before him with the spirit and the power of Elijah, to
   reconcile fathers to their children, and to bring the disobedient back
   to the wisdom of upright men, to make a people perfectly ready for the
   Lord."

   ^18Zechariah said to the angel,

   "How am I to know that this is so? For I am an old man, and my wife is
   advanced in life."

   ^19The angel answered,

   "I am Gabriel. I stand in the very presence of God. I have been sent to
   speak to you and to tell you this good news.

   ^20Now you will keep silent and be unable to speak until the day when
   this happens, because you have not believed what I have said, for it
   will all be fulfilled in due time."

   ^21The people were waiting for Zechariah, and wondering that he stayed
   so long in the sanctuary.

   ^22But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they knew that
   he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. For his part, he kept making
   signs to them, and remained dumb.

   ^23And when his period of service was over, he went back to his home.

   ^24Soon afterward his wife Elizabeth began to expect a child, and she
   kept herself in seclusion for five months.

   ^25"This is what the Lord has done for me," she said, "now that he has
   deigned to remove the disgrace I have endured."

   ^26In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in
   Galilee called Nazareth,

   ^27to a maiden there who was engaged to be married to a man named
   Joseph, a descendant of David. The maiden's name was Mary.

   ^28And the angel went into the town and said to her,

   "Good morning, favored woman! The Lord be with you!"

   ^29But she was startled at what he said, and wondered what this
   greeting meant.

   ^30And the angel said to her,

   "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have gained God's approval.

   ^31You are to become a mother and you will give birth to a son, and you
   are to name him Jesus.

   ^32He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The
   Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David,

   ^33and he will reign over Jacob's house forever; his reign will have no
   end."

   ^34Mary said to the angel,

   "How can this be, when I have no husband?"

   ^35The angel answered,

   "The holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High
   will overshadow you. For that reason your child will be called holy,
   and the Son of God.

   ^36And your relative, Elizabeth, although she is old, is going to give
   birth to a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was said to be
   barren.

   ^37For nothing is ever impossible for God."

   ^38And Mary said,

   "I am the Lord's slave. Let it be as you say."

   Then the angel left her.

   ^39In those days Mary set out and hurried to the hill-country, to a
   town in Judah,

   ^40and she went to Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth.

   ^41When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe stirred within her.
   And Elizabeth was filled with the holy Spirit

   ^42and she gave a great cry, and said,

   "You are the most favored of women,

   And blessed is your child!

   ^43Who am I,

   To have the mother of my Lord come to me?

   ^44"For the moment your greeting reached my ears,

   The child stirred with joy within me!

   ^45Blessed is she who has believed,

   For what the Lord has promised her will be fulfilled!"

   ^46And Mary said,

   "My heart extols the Lord,

   ^47My spirit exults in God my Savior.

   ^48For he has noticed his slave in her humble station,

   For from this time all the ages will think me favored!

   ^49"For the Almighty has done wonders for me,

   How holy his name is!

   ^50He shows his mercy age after age

   To those who fear him.

   ^51"He has done mighty deeds with his arm,

   He has routed the proud-minded,

   ^52He has dethroned monarchs and exalted the poor,

   ^53He has satisfied the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away
   empty-handed.

   ^54"He has helped his servant Israel,

   Remembering his mercy,

   ^55As he promised our forefathers

   To have mercy on Abraham and his descendants forever!"

   ^56So Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned home.

   ^57Now the time came for Elizabeth's child to be born, and she gave
   birth to a son.

   ^58Her neighbors and relatives heard of the great mercy the Lord had
   shown her, and they came and congratulated her.

   ^59On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were
   going to name him Zechariah, after his father.

   ^60But his mother said,

   "No! He is to be named John."

   ^61They said to her,

   "There is no one among your relatives who bears that name."

   ^62But they made signs to the child's father and asked him what he
   wished to have the child named.

   ^63He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote,

   "His name is John."

   ^64And they were all amazed. Then his voice and the use of his tongue
   were immediately restored, and he blessed God aloud.

   ^65And all their neighbors were overcome with fear, and all over the
   hill-country of Judea all these stories were told,

   ^66and everyone who heard them kept them in mind, and said,

   "What is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.

   ^67And his father Zechariah was filled with the holy Spirit and he
   uttered a divine message, saying,

   ^68"Blessings on the Lord, the God of Israel,

   Because he has turned his attention to his people, and brought about
   their deliverance,

   ^69And he has produced a mighty Savior for us

   In the house of his servant David.

   ^70"By the lips of his holy prophets he promised of old to do this--

   ^71To save us from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,

   ^72Thus showing mercy to our forefathers,

   And keeping his sacred agreement,

   ^73"And the oath that he swore to our forefather Abraham,

   ^74That we should be delivered from the hands of our enemies,

   ^75And should serve him in holiness and uprightness, unafraid,

   In his own presence all our lives.

   ^76"And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,

   For you will go before the Lord to make his way ready,

   ^77Bringing his people the knowledge of salvation

   Through the forgiveness of their sins.

   ^78"Because the heart of our God is merciful,

   And so the day will dawn upon us from on high,

   ^79To shine on men who sit in darkness and the shadow of death,

   And guide our feet into the way of peace."

   ^80And the child grew up and became strong in the Spirit, and he lived
   in the desert until the day when he proclaimed himself to Israel.

  Chapter 2

   ^1In those days an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a
   census of the whole world should be taken.

   ^2It was the first census, taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.

   ^3So everyone went to his own town to register.

   ^4And Joseph went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea to
   the city of David called Bethlehem, because he belonged to the house
   and family of David,

   ^5to register with Mary, who was engaged to him and who was soon to
   become a mother.

   ^6While they were there, the time came for her child to be born,

   ^7and she gave birth to her first-born son; and she wrapped him up, and
   laid him in a manger, for there was no room for them at the inn.

   ^8There were some shepherds in that neighborhood keeping watch through
   the night over their flock in the open fields.

   ^9And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord
   shone around them, and they were terribly frightened.

   ^10The angel said to them,

   "Do not be frightened, for I bring you good news of a great joy that is
   to be felt by all the people,

   ^11for today, in the town of David, a Savior for you has been born who
   is your Messiah and Lord.

   ^12And this will prove it to you: You will find a baby wrapped up and
   lying in a manger."

   ^13Suddenly there appeared with the angel a throng of the heavenly
   army, praising God, saying,

   ^14"Glory to God in heaven and on earth!

   Peace to the men he favors!"

   ^15When the angels left them and returned to heaven, the shepherds said
   to one another,

   "Come! Let us go over to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has
   happened, that the Lord has told us of!"

   ^16And they hurried there, and found Mary and Joseph, with the baby
   lying in the manger.

   ^17When they saw this, they told what had been said to them about this
   child.

   ^18And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,

   ^19but Mary treasured up all they had said, and pondered over it.

   ^20And the shepherds went back glorifying God and praising him for all
   that they had heard and seen in fulfilment of what they had been told.

   ^21When he was eight days old and it was time to circumcise him, he was
   named Jesus, as the angel had named him, before his birth was first
   expected.

   ^22When their purification period under the Law of Moses was over, they
   took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,

   ^23in fulfilment of the requirement of the Law of the Lord, "Every
   first-born male shall be considered consecrated to the Lord,"

   ^24and to offer the sacrifice prescribed in the Law of the Lord, "A
   pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons."

   ^25Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Symeon, an upright, devout
   man, who was living in expectation of the comforting of Israel, and
   under the influence of the holy Spirit.

   ^26It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not
   die without seeing the Lord's Messiah.

   ^27And under the Spirit's influence he went into the Temple, and when
   Jesus' parents brought him there to do for him what the Law required,

   ^28Symeon also took him in his arms and blessed God, and said,

   ^29"Now, Master, you will let your slave go free

   In peace, as you promised,

   ^30For my eyes have seen your salvation

   ^31Which you have set before all the nations,

   ^32A light of revelation for the heathen,

   And a glory to your people Israel!"

   ^33The child's father and mother were astonished at what Symeon said.

   ^34And he gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child's mother,

   "This child is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel,
   and to be a portent that will be much debated--

   ^35you yourself will be pierced to the heart--and so the thoughts of
   many minds will be revealed."

   ^36There was also a prophetess there named Hannah, the daughter of
   Phanuel, who belonged to the tribe of Asher. She was very old, for
   after her girlhood she had been married for seven years,

   ^37and she had been a widow until she was now eighty-four. She never
   left the Temple, but worshipped night and day with fasting and prayer.

   ^38She came up just at that time and gave thanks to God and spoke about
   the child to all who were living in expectation of the liberation of
   Jerusalem.

   ^39When they had done everything that the Law of the Lord required,
   they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.

   ^40And the child grew up and became strong and thoughtful, with God's
   blessing resting on him.

   ^41His parents used to go to Jerusalem every year at the Passover
   Festival.

   ^42And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual to the
   festival and made their customary stay.

   ^43When they started back the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem
   without his parents' knowledge.

   ^44They supposed that he was somewhere in the party, and traveled until
   the end of the first day's journey, and then they looked everywhere for
   him among their relatives and acquaintances.

   ^45As they could not find him, they went back to Jerusalem in search of
   him.

   ^46And on the third day they found him in the Temple, sitting among the
   teachers, listening to them and asking them questions,

   ^47and everyone who heard him was astonished at his intelligence and at
   the answers he made.

   ^48When his parents saw him they were amazed, and his mother said to
   him.

   "My child, why did you treat us like this? Here your father and I have
   been looking for you, and have been very anxious."

   ^49He said to them,

   "How did you come to look for me? Did you not know that I must be at my
   Father's house?"

   ^50But they did not understand what he told them.

   ^51And he went back with them to Nazareth and obeyed them. And his
   mother treasured all these things up in her mind.

   ^52As Jesus grew older he gained in wisdom and won the approval of God
   and men.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when
   Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod governor of Galilee,
   while his brother Philip was governor of the territory of Iturea and
   Trachonitis, and Lysanias was the governor of Abilene,

   ^2in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, a message from God came
   to Zechariah's son John in the desert.

   ^3And he went all through the Jordan Valley preaching repentance and
   baptism in order to obtain the forgiveness of sins,

   ^4as the book of the sermons of the prophet Isaiah says,

   "Hark! Someone is shouting in the desert,

   Get the Lord's way ready!

   Make his paths straight.

   ^5Every hollow must be filled up,

   And every mountain and hill leveled.

   What is crooked is to be made straight,

   And the rough roads are to be made smooth,

   ^6And all mankind is to see how God can save!"

   ^7So he would say to the crowds that came out there to be baptized by
   him,

   "You brood of snakes! Who warned you to fly from the wrath that is
   coming?

   ^8Then produce fruit that will be consistent with your professed
   repentance! And do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham for
   our forefather,' for I tell you, God can produce descendants for
   Abraham right out of these stones!

   ^9But the axe is already lying at the roots of the trees. Any tree that
   fails to produce good fruit is going to be cut down and thrown into the
   fire."

   ^10The crowds would ask him,

   "Then what ought we to do?"

   ^11And he answered,

   "The man who has two shirts must share with the man who has none, and
   the man who has food must do the same."

   ^12Even tax-collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him,

   "Master, what ought we to do?"

   ^13He said to them,

   "Do not collect any more than you are authorized to."

   ^14And soldiers would ask him,

   "And what ought we to do?"

   He said to them,

   "Do not extort money or make false charges against people, but be
   satisfied with your pay."

   ^15As all this aroused people's expectations, and they were all
   wondering in their hearts whether John was the Christ,

   ^16John said to them all,

   "I am only baptizing you in water, but someone is coming who is
   stronger than I am, whose shoes I am not fit to untie. He will baptize
   you in the holy Spirit and in fire.

   ^17He has his winnowing fork in his hand, to clean up his
   threshing-floor, and store his wheat in his barn, but he will burn up
   the chaff with inextinguishable fire."

   ^18So with many varied exhortations he would preach the good news to
   the people,

   ^19but Herod the governor, whom he condemned because of Herodias, his
   brother's wife, and all the wicked things Herod had done,

   ^20crowned them all by putting John in prison.

   ^21Now when all the people were baptized and when Jesus also after his
   baptism was praying, heaven opened

   ^22and the holy Spirit came down upon him in the material shape of a
   dove, and there came a voice from heaven,

   "You are my Son, my Beloved! You are my Chosen!"

   ^23Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his work. He
   was the son, it was supposed, of Joseph, the son of Eli,

   ^24the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of
   Jannai, the son of Joseph,

   ^25the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of
   Esli, the son of Naggai,

   ^26the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son
   of Josech, the son of Joda,

   ^27the son of Johanan, the son of Resa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son
   of Salathiel, the son of Neri,

   ^28the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of
   Elmadam, the son of Er,

   ^29the son of Jesus, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of
   Matthat, the son of Levi,

   ^30the son of Symeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of
   Jonam, the son of Eliakim,

   ^31the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of
   Nathan, the son of David,

   ^32the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala,
   the son of Nahshon,

   ^33the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of
   Perez, the son of Judah,

   ^34the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of
   Terah, the son of Nahor,

   ^35the son of Serug, the son of Ragau, the son of Peleg, the son of
   Heber, the son of Shelah,

   ^36the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of
   Noah, the son of Lamech,

   ^37the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son
   of Maleleel, the son of Cainan,

   ^38the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

  Chapter 4

   ^1Jesus returned from the Jordan full of the holy Spirit, and he was
   led about in the desert

   ^2for forty days by the Spirit, and was tempted by the devil. In all
   those days he ate nothing, and when they were over he was famished.

   ^3And the devil said to him,

   "If you are God's son, tell this stone to turn into bread!"

   ^4Jesus answered,

   "The Scripture says, Not on bread alone is man to live!' "

   ^5And he took him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of
   the world.

   ^6And the devil said to him,

   "I will give you all this power and their splendor, for it has been
   turned over to me, and I can give it to anyone I please.

   ^7If you will do homage before me, it shall all be yours."

   ^8Jesus answered,

   "The Scripture says, You must do homage before the Lord your God, and
   worship him alone.' "

   ^9And he took him to Jerusalem, and made him stand on the summit of the
   Temple, and said to him,

   "If you are God's son, throw yourself down from here,

   ^10for the Scripture says, He will give his angels orders about you, to
   protect you,'

   ^11and, They will lift you up with their hands, so that you may never
   strike your foot against a stone.' "

   ^12Jesus answered,

   "We have been told, You shall not try the Lord your God.' "

   ^13When the devil had tried every kind of temptation he left him till
   another time.

   ^14Under the power of the Spirit Jesus returned to Galilee, and news of
   him went all over that region.

   ^15And he taught in their synagogues, and was honored by them all.

   ^16And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the
   Sabbath he went to the synagogue, as he was accustomed to do, and stood
   up to read the Scriptures.

   ^17And the roll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him, and he
   unrolled it and found the place where it says,

   ^18"The spirit of the Lord is upon me,

   For he has consecrated me to preach the good news to the poor,

   He has sent me to announce to the prisoners their release and to the
   blind the recovery of their sight,

   To set the down-trodden at liberty,

   ^19To proclaim the year of the Lord's favor!"

   ^20And he rolled up the roll and gave it back to the attendant and sat
   down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed upon him.

   ^21And he began by saying to them,

   "This passage of Scripture has been fulfilled here in your hearing
   today!"

   ^22And they all spoke well of him and were astonished at the winning
   words that fell from his lips, and they said,

   "Is he not Joseph's son?"

   ^23He said to them,

   "No doubt you will quote this proverb to me: Doctor, cure yourself! Do
   the things here in your own country that we hear you did at Capernaum.'

   ^24I tell you," said he, "no prophet is welcome in his own country.

   ^25But, I tell you, there were plenty of widows in Israel in Elijah's
   time, when the sky was closed for three years and a half, and there was
   a great famine all over the land,

   ^26and Elijah was not sent to one of them, but to a widow at Zarephath
   in Sidon.

   ^27And there were plenty of lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet
   Elisha, and none of them was cured, but Naaman the Syrian."

   ^28And when the people in the synagogue heard this, they were all very
   angry,

   ^29and they got up and drove him out of the town and took him to the
   brow of the hill on which their town was built, intending to throw him
   down from it.

   ^30But he made his way through the midst of them and went on.

   ^31And he came down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee. And he taught them
   on the Sabbath,

   ^32and they were amazed at his teaching, for he spoke with authority.

   ^33There was a man in the synagogue who was possessed by the spirit of
   a foul demon and he cried out loudly,

   ^34"Ha! What do you want of us, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to
   destroy us? I know who you are! You are God's Holy One!"

   ^35Jesus reproved him and said,

   "Silence! Get out of him!"

   And the demon threw the man down in the midst of them, and came out of
   him, without doing him any harm.

   ^36And they were all amazed and said to one another,

   "What is the meaning of this teaching? For he gives orders
   authoritatively and effectually to the foul spirits, and they come
   out."

   ^37And news of him spread to every place in that region.

   ^38When he got up and left the synagogue, he went to Simon's house. And
   Simon's mother-in-law was suffering with a severe attack of fever, and
   they asked him about her.

   ^39And he stood over her and reproved the fever and it left her, and
   she got up and waited on them.

   ^40As the sun went down all who had friends sick with various diseases
   brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and
   cured them.

   ^41And demons came out of many people, crying out,

   "You are the Son of God!"

   But he reproved them and forbade them to speak, because they knew he
   was the Christ.

   ^42When it was day, he left the house and made his way to a lonely
   spot, and crowds of people went in search of him, and overtook him and
   tried to keep him from leaving them.

   ^43But he said to them,

   "I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other towns
   also, for that is what I was sent to do."

   ^44So he went about Judea, preaching in the synagogues.

  Chapter 5

   ^1Once as the crowd was pressing about him to hear God's message, he
   happened to be standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,

   ^2and he saw two boats on the shore of the lake, for the fishermen had
   gotten out of them and were washing their nets.

   ^3And he got into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked
   him to push out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught
   the crowds of people from the boat.

   ^4When he stopped speaking, he said to Simon,

   "Push out into deep water, and then put down your nets for a haul."

   ^5Simon answered,

   "Master, we worked all night and caught nothing, but as you tell me to
   do it, I will put down the nets."

   ^6So they did so, and inclosed such a shoal of fish that their nets
   began to break.

   ^7And they signaled to their comrades in the other boat to come and
   help them. And they came, and they filled both boats so full that they
   began to sink.

   ^8When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' feet and said,

   "Leave me, Master, for I am a sinful man."

   ^9For he and all the men with him were perfectly amazed at the haul of
   fish they had made,

   ^10and so were Zebedee's sons, James and John, who were Simon's
   partners. Jesus said to Simon,

   "Do not be afraid. From now on you are to catch men!"

   ^11And they brought the boats to land and left everything and followed
   him.

   ^12When he was in one of the towns, he came upon a man covered with
   leprosy. And when he saw Jesus he fell down on his face, and begged
   him, saying,

   "If you only choose, sir, you can cure me!"

   ^13And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying,

   "I do choose! Be cured!"

   And the leprosy immediately left him,

   ^14Then he warned him to tell nobody,

   "But go," he said, "show yourself to the priest, and in proof of your
   cure make the offerings for your purification, just as Moses
   prescribed."

   ^15Yet the news about him spread more and more, and great crowds
   gathered to hear him and to be cured of their diseases.

   ^16But Jesus himself would retire into the desert and pray.

   ^17One day as he was teaching, there were some Pharisees and experts in
   the Law sitting near by, who had come from every village in Galilee and
   Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was there, so that he
   might cure people.

   ^18Some men came up carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they
   tried to get him in and lay him before Jesus.

   ^19And as they could find no way to get him in, on account of the
   crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his mat through
   the tiles, among the people in front of Jesus.

   ^20When he saw their faith, he said,

   "Friend, your sins are forgiven!"

   ^21And the scribes and the Pharisees began to debate and say,

   "Who is this man who talks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God
   alone?"

   ^22But Jesus saw what they were discussing, and said to them,

   "What are you pondering over in your minds?

   ^23Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, Get up
   and walk'?

   ^24But to let you know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive
   sins on earth"--turning to the man who was paralyzed he said to him--"I
   tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home!"

   ^25And he got up at once before them all, and picked up what he had
   been lying on, and went home, praising God.

   ^26They were all seized with astonishment, and praised God, and filled
   with awe they said,

   "We have seen something wonderful today!"

   ^27After this he went out, and he saw a tax-collector named Levi
   sitting at the tollhouse, and he said to him,

   "Follow me!"

   ^28And he left everything and got up and followed him.

   ^29Then Levi gave a great entertainment for him in his house, and there
   was a great throng of tax-collectors and others who were at table with
   them.

   ^30And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled about it to his
   disciples, and said,

   "Why do you eat and drink with tax-collectors and irreligious people?"

   ^31Jesus answered them,

   "It is not well people but the sick who have to have the doctor.

   ^32I have not come to invite the pious but the irreligious to
   repentance!"

   ^33They said to him,

   "John's disciples observe frequent fasts and offer prayers, and so do
   the disciples of the Pharisees, but your disciples eat and drink."

   ^34Jesus said to them,

   "Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?

   ^35But other days will come, and when the bridegroom is taken away from
   them, in those days they will fast."

   ^36He used this figure also in speaking to them:

   "No one tears a piece from a new coat and sews it on an old one, or if
   he does, he will both tear the new one and the piece from the new one
   will not match the old one.

   ^37And nobody puts new wine into old wine-skins, or if he does, the new
   wine will burst the skins and run out, and the skins will be spoiled.

   ^38New wine has to be put into fresh skins.

   ^39No one after drinking old wine wants new, for he says, The old is
   better!' "
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1One Sabbath he happened to be passing through the wheat fields, and
   his disciples were picking the heads of wheat, and eating them, rubbing
   them in their hands.

   ^2And some of the Pharisees said,

   "Why do you do what it is against the Law to do on the Sabbath?"

   ^3Jesus answered,

   "Have you not read even what David did, when he and his companions were
   hungry?

   ^4How he went into the house of God and took the Presentation Loaves,
   which it was against the Law for anyone but the priests to eat, and ate
   them with his companions?"

   ^5And he said to them, "The Son of Man is master of the Sabbath."

   ^6On another Sabbath he happened to go to the synagogue and teach.
   There was a man there whose right hand was withered.

   ^7And the scribes and the Pharisees were on the watch to see whether he
   would cure people on the Sabbath, in order to find a charge to bring
   against him.

   ^8But he knew what they were thinking, and he said to the man with the
   withered hand,

   "Get up and stand in front."

   And he got up and stood there.

   ^9Jesus said to them,

   "I want to ask you, Is it allowable on the Sabbath to do people good or
   to do them harm? to save life or to destroy it?"

   ^10And he looked around at them all and said to the man,

   "Hold out your hand!"

   And he did so, and his hand was restored.

   ^11But they were perfectly furious, and discussed with one another what
   they could do to Jesus.

   ^12It was in those days that he went up on the mountain to pray, and
   passed the whole night in prayer to God.

   ^13When day came, he called his disciples to him, and chose twelve of
   them whom he named apostles:

   ^14Simon, whom he named Peter, his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip,
   Bartholomew,

   ^15Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alpheus, Simon, who was called
   the Zealot,

   ^16Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who turned out a
   traitor.

   ^17And he came down with them and took his stand on a level place with
   a great throng of his disciples, and a large number of people from all
   over Judea and from Jerusalem and the seacoast district of Tyre and
   Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be cured of their diseases.

   ^18And those who were troubled with foul spirits were cured.

   ^19And all the people tried to touch him, because power went forth from
   him and cured them all.

   ^20Then he fixed his eyes on his disciples, and said,

   "Blessed are you who are poor, for the Kingdom of God is yours!

   ^21"Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be satisfied!

   "Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh!

   ^22"Blessed are you when people hate you and exclude you and denounce
   you and spurn the name you bear as evil, on account of the Son of Man.

   ^23Be glad when that happens, and leap for joy, for you will be richly
   rewarded in heaven, for that is the way their forefathers treated the
   prophets.

   ^24"But alas for you who are rich, for you have had your comfort!

   ^25"Alas for you who have plenty to eat now, for you will be hungry!

   "Alas for you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep!

   ^26"Alas for you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is the way
   their forefathers treated the false prophets!

   ^27"But I tell you who hear me, love your enemies, treat those who hate
   you well,

   ^28bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.

   ^29To the man that strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and
   from the man who takes away your coat, do not keep back your shirt
   either.

   ^30Give to everyone that asks of you, and if anyone takes away what is
   yours, do not demand it back.

   ^31And treat men just as you wish them to treat you.

   ^32If you love only those who love you, what merit is there in that?
   For even godless people love those who love them.

   ^33And if you help only those who help you, what merit is there in
   that? Even godless people act in that way.

   ^34And if you lend only to people from whom you expect to get
   something, what merit is there in that? Even godless people lend to
   godless people, meaning to get it back again in full.

   ^35But love your enemies, and help them and lend to them, never
   despairing, and you will be richly rewarded, and you will be sons of
   the Most High, for he is kind even to the ungrateful and the wicked.

   ^36You must be merciful, just as your Father is.

   ^37Do not judge others, and they will not judge you. Do not condemn
   them, and they will not condemn you. Excuse others and they will excuse
   you.

   ^38Give, and they will give to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken
   together, and running over, they will pour into your lap. For the
   measure you use with others they in turn will use with you."

   ^39And he used a figure saying,

   "Can one blind man lead another? Will they not both fall into a hole?

   ^40A pupil is not better than his teacher, but every pupil when he is
   fully trained will be like his teacher.

   ^41Why do you keep looking at the speck in your brother's eye, and pay
   no attention to the beam that is in your own?

   ^42How can you say to your brother, Brother, just let me get that speck
   out of your eye,' when you cannot see the beam in your own eye? You
   hypocrite! First get the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see
   to get out the speck in your brother's eye.

   ^43For sound trees do not bear bad fruit, nor bad trees sound fruit.

   ^44Every tree is known by its fruit. They do not pick figs off thorns,
   or gather grapes from brambles.

   ^45A good man, out of the good he has accumulated in his heart,
   produces good, and a bad man, out of what he has accumulated that is
   bad, produces what is bad. For his mouth says only what his heart is
   full of.

   ^46Why do you call me: Lord! Lord!' and not do what I tell you?

   ^47If anyone comes to me and listens to this teaching of mine and acts
   upon it, I will show you whom he is like.

   ^48He is like a man who was building a house, who dug deep and laid his
   foundation upon the rock, and when there was a flood the torrent burst
   upon that house and could not shake it, because it was well built.

   ^49But the man who listens to it, and does not act upon it, is like a
   man who built a house on the ground without any foundation. The torrent
   burst upon it, and it collapsed at once, and the wreck of that house
   was complete."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1When he had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he
   went to Capernaum.

   ^2A Roman captain had a slave whom he thought a great deal of, and the
   slave was sick and at the point of death.

   ^3When the captain heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to
   him, to ask him to come and save his slave's life.

   ^4And they went to Jesus and urged him strongly to do it, and said,

   "He deserves to have you do this for him,

   ^5for he loves our nation, and it was he who built us our synagogue."

   ^6So Jesus went with them. But when he was not far from the house, the
   captain sent some friends to him, to say to him,

   "Master, do not take any more trouble, for I am not a suitable person
   to have you under my roof.

   ^7That is why I did not think I was fit to come to you. But simply say
   the word, and have my servant cured.

   ^8For I am myself under the orders of others, and I have soldiers under
   me, and I tell one to go, and he goes, and another to come, and he
   comes, and my slave to do something, and he does it."

   ^9When Jesus heard this, he was astonished at him, and turning to the
   crowd that was following him, he said,

   "I tell you, I have not found such faith as this even in Israel!"

   ^10And when the messengers went back to the house, they found the slave
   well.

   ^11Soon afterward he happened to go to a town called Nain, and his
   disciples and a great throng of people were with him.

   ^12As he came up to the gate of the town, a dead man was being carried
   out; he was his mother's only son, and she was a widow. A crowd of the
   townspeople was with her.

   ^13And when the Master saw her, he pitied her, and said to her,

   "Do not weep."

   ^14And he went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stopped. And he
   said,

   "Young man, I tell you, wake up!"

   ^15And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him back to
   his mother.

   ^16And they were all overcome with awe, and they praised God, and said,

   "A great prophet has appeared among us!" and "God has not forgotten his
   people!"

   ^17This story about him spread all over Judea and the surrounding
   country.

   ^18John's disciples told him of all this,

   ^19and he called two of them to him, and sent them to the Master to ask
   him,

   "Are you the one who was to come, or should we look for someone else?"

   ^20And the men went to him and said,

   "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, Are you the one who was to
   come, or should we look for someone else?' "

   ^21Just then he cured many of diseases and ailments and evil spirits,
   and he gave sight to many who were blind.

   ^22And he answered them,

   "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard. The blind are
   regaining their sight, the lame can walk, the lepers are being cured
   and the deaf can hear, the dead are being raised and good news is being
   preached to the poor.

   ^23And blessed is the man who finds nothing that repels him in me."

   ^24When John's messengers were gone, he began to speak to the crowds
   about John.

   "What was it that you went out into the desert to look at? A reed
   swaying in the wind?

   ^25Then what did you go out there to see? A man luxuriously dressed?
   Men who wear fine clothes and live in luxury you find in palaces.

   ^26Then what did you go out there to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you,
   and far more than a prophet!

   ^27This is the man of whom the Scripture says,

   " Here I send my messenger on before you,

   He will prepare the road ahead of you!'

   ^28"I tell you, among men born of women there is none greater than
   John; and yet those who are of little importance in the Kingdom of God
   are greater than he.

   ^29And all the people, even the tax-collectors, when they heard him,
   acknowledged the justice of God's demands, by accepting baptism from
   John,

   ^30but the Pharisees and experts in the Law thwarted God's purpose for
   themselves, by refusing to be baptized by him.

   ^31So what is there to which I can compare the men of this age? What
   are they like?

   ^32They are like children sitting about in the bazaar and calling out
   to one another,

   " We have played the flute for you, and you would not dance!

   We have wailed and you would not weep!'

   ^33"For when John the Baptist came, he did not eat any bread or drink
   any wine, and you said, He has a demon!'

   ^34Now that the Son of Man has come, he does eat and drink, and you
   say, Look at him! A glutton and a drinker, the companion of
   tax-collectors and irreligious people!'

   ^35So wisdom is vindicated by all who are really wise."

   ^36One of the Pharisees asked him to have dinner with him, and he went
   to the Pharisee's house and took his place at the table.

   ^37Now there was a woman in the town who was leading a sinful life, and
   when she learned that he was having dinner at the Pharisee's house, she
   got an alabaster flask of perfume,

   ^38and came and stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to wet
   his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with her hair, and kissed
   them, and put the perfume on them.

   ^39When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself,

   "If this man were really a prophet, he would know who and what the
   woman is who is touching him, for she leads a wicked life."

   ^40Jesus answered him, and said to him,

   "Simon, there is something I want to say to you."

   He said,

   "Proceed, Master."

   ^41"Two men were in debt to a money-lender. One owed him a hundred
   dollars and the other ten.

   ^42As they could not pay him, he canceled what they owed him. Now which
   of them will be more attached to him?"

   ^43Simon answered,

   "The one, I suppose, for whom he canceled most."

   "You are right," he said.

   ^44And turning to the woman, he said to Simon,

   "Do you see this woman? I came to your house; you did not give me any
   water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with tears and wiped them
   with her hair.

   ^45You did not give me a kiss, but from the moment I came in she has
   not stopped kissing my feet.

   ^46You did not put any oil upon my head, but she has put perfume upon
   my feet.

   ^47Therefore, I tell you, her sins, many as they are, are forgiven, for
   she has loved me so much. But the man with little to be forgiven loves
   me but little."

   ^48And he said to her,

   "Your sins are forgiven!"

   ^49The men at table with him began to say to themselves,

   "Who is this man, who even forgives sins?"

   ^50But he said to the woman,

   "It is your faith that has saved you. Go in peace."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1Soon afterward he went about among the villages and towns preaching
   and telling the good news of the Kingdom of God. The Twelve went with
   him,

   ^2and some women who had been cured of evil spirits and sickness--Mary,
   who was called Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons had been
   driven,

   ^3and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's manager, and Susanna, and many
   others, who provided for them with their means.

   ^4When a great throng was gathering and people were coming to him from
   one town after another, he said in his figurative way,

   ^5"A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some of the seed
   fell by the path and was trodden on, and the wild birds ate it up.

   ^6And some of it fell upon the rock, and when it sprang up it withered,
   because it had no moisture.

   ^7And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and
   choked it out.

   ^8And some fell on good soil, and grew up and yielded a hundred fold!"

   As he said this he called out,

   "Let him who has ears to hear with, listen!"

   ^9His disciples asked him what this figure meant.

   ^10And he said,

   "You are permitted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God, but they
   are given to others in the form of figures, so that they may look and
   yet not see, and hear and yet not understand.

   ^11This is what the figure means. The seed is God's message.

   ^12The ones by the path are those who hear, and then the devil comes
   and carries off the message from their hearts, so that they may not
   believe it and be saved.

   ^13The ones on the rock are those who receive the message joyfully when
   they first hear it, but it takes no real root. They believe for a
   little while, and then in the time of trial they draw back.

   ^14And what falls among the thorns means those who listen and pass on,
   and the worries and wealth and pleasures of life stifle them and they
   yield nothing.

   ^15But the seed in the good soil means those who listen to the message
   and keep it in good, true hearts, and yield unfailingly.

   ^16"Nobody lights a lamp and then covers it with a dish or puts it
   under a bed, but he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may
   see the light.

   ^17For there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed, nor kept
   secret that shall not be known and come to light.

   ^18So take care how you listen. For people who have will have more
   given to them, and from people who have nothing, even what they think
   they have will be taken away."

   ^19His mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not get near
   him, on account of the crowd.

   ^20And the word came to him,

   "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside; they want to see
   you."

   ^21He answered,

   "My mother and my brothers are those who listen to God's message and
   obey it!"

   ^22It happened one day that he got into a boat with his disciples, and
   said to them,

   "Let us cross to the other side of the lake."

   ^23So they set sail. As they sailed along, he fell asleep. And a squall
   of wind came down upon the lake, and they were being swamped and were
   in peril.

   ^24And they went to him and woke him up, and said to him,

   "Master! Master! We are lost!"

   Then he awoke and reproved the wind and the rough water, and they
   ceased, and there was a calm.

   ^25And he said to them,

   "Where is your faith?"

   But they were frightened and amazed, and said to one another,

   "Who can he be? For he gives orders even to the winds and the water,
   and they obey him!"

   ^26They made a landing in the neighborhood of Gerasa, which is just
   across the lake from Galilee.

   ^27And when he landed, he met a man possessed by demons, who was coming
   out of the town. He had worn no clothing for a long time, and did not
   live in a house but in the tombs.

   ^28When he saw Jesus he cried out and threw himself down before him,
   and said in a loud voice,

   "What do you want of me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not
   to torture me!"

   ^29For he was commanding the foul spirit to get out of the man. For it
   had often seized him, and though he had been fastened with chains and
   fetters, and was closely watched, he would snap his bonds and the demon
   would drive him away to the desert.

   ^30And Jesus asked him,

   "What is your name?"

   He said,

   "Legion!" For many demons had gone into him.

   ^31And they begged him not to order them off to the bottomless pit.

   ^32Now there was a large drove of pigs feeding there on the hillside,
   and they begged him to give them leave to go into them. And he did so.

   ^33Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the
   drove rushed over the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.

   ^34When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran away
   and spread the news in the town and in the country around.

   ^35And the people came out to see what had happened, and they came to
   Jesus and found the man out of whom the demons had gone sitting there,
   at Jesus' feet, with his clothes on and in his right mind, and they
   were frightened.

   ^36And those who had seen it told them how the man who had been
   possessed was cured.

   ^37Then all the people of the neighborhood of Gerasa asked him to go
   away from them, for they were terribly frightened. And he got into a
   boat and went back.

   ^38The man out of whom the demons had gone begged to go with him, but
   Jesus sent him away, and said,

   ^39"Go back to your home, and tell all that God has done for you."

   And he went and told all over the town what Jesus had done for him.

   ^40When Jesus returned, the people welcomed him, for they were all
   watching for him.

   ^41And a man named Jairus came up--he was leader of the synagogue--and
   he fell down at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house,

   ^42because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was
   dying. As he was going, the crowds of people almost crushed him.

   ^43And a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and whom
   nobody had been able to cure,

   ^44came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak, and the
   hemorrhage stopped at once.

   ^45Jesus said,

   "Who was it who touched me?" And as everyone denied having done so,
   Peter said,

   "Master, the people are all around you and they are crowding you."

   ^46But Jesus said,

   "Somebody touched me, for I know that power passed from me."

   ^47When the woman saw that she had not escaped his notice, she came
   forward trembling, and fell down before him, and before all the people
   told why she had touched him, and how she had been cured at once.

   ^48And he said to her,

   "My daughter, it is your faith that has cured you. Go in peace."

   ^49Even as he spoke someone came from the house of the leader of the
   synagogue and said,

   "Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Master any more."

   ^50But Jesus heard it and said to him,

   "Do not be afraid; just have faith, and she will get well."

   ^51When he got to the house, he let no one go in with him but Peter,
   John, and James, and the child's father and mother.

   ^52And they were all wailing and beating their breasts for her. But he
   said,

   "Stop wailing! For she is not dead, she is asleep."

   ^53And they laughed at him, for they knew that she was dead.

   ^54But he grasped her hand and called out,

   "Get up, my child!"

   ^55And her spirit returned and she stood up immediately, and he
   directed them to give her something to eat.

   ^56And her parents were amazed, but he ordered them not to tell anyone
   what had happened.

  Chapter 9

   ^1Then he called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority
   over all the demons, and to cure diseases,

   ^2and he sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to cure the
   sick.

   ^3He said to them,

   "Do not take anything for your journey, no staff nor bag nor bread nor
   money, nor an extra shirt.

   ^4Whatever house you go to stay in, remain there, and start on again
   from it.

   ^5And where they will not welcome you, leave that town and shake off
   the very dust from your feet as a protest against them."

   ^6And they set forth and went from village to village, telling the good
   news and curing people everywhere.

   ^7Herod the governor heard of all that was happening, and he was
   perplexed because some people said that John had risen from the dead,

   ^8and some that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the ancient
   prophets had come back to life.

   ^9But Herod said,

   "John I have beheaded, but who can this be about whom I hear such
   reports?"

   And he endeavored to see him.

   ^10Then the apostles came back and told Jesus what they had done. And
   he took them and quietly retired to a town called Bethsaida.

   ^11But the crowds learned of it and followed him, and he welcomed them
   and spoke to them about the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who
   needed to be cured.

   ^12When the day began to decline, the Twelve came up and said to him,

   "Send the crowd away to the villages and farms around to find food and
   shelter, for we are in a lonely place here."

   ^13But he said to them,

   "Give them food yourselves!"

   And they said,

   "We have only five loaves and two fish, unless we go ourselves and buy
   food for all these people."

   ^14For there were about five thousand men.

   But he said to his disciples,

   "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."

   ^15And they did so, and made them all sit down.

   ^16Then he took the five loaves and the two fish and looked up to
   heaven and blessed them, and he broke them in pieces and gave them to
   the disciples to pass to the people.

   ^17And they all ate and had enough, and the pieces left over that were
   gathered up filled twelve baskets.

   ^18Once when he was praying by himself, with only the disciples near
   him, he asked them,

   "Who do the people say that I am?"

   ^19They answered,

   "John the Baptist, though others say Elijah, and others that one of the
   old prophets has come back to life."

   ^20And he said to them,

   "But who do you say that I am?"

   Peter answered,

   "The Christ of God!"

   ^21But he warned them particularly not to tell this to anyone,

   ^22and said,

   "The Son of Man must endure great suffering and be refused by the
   elders, the high priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and be raised
   to life on the third day."

   ^23And he said to everyone,

   "If anyone wants to go with me, he must disregard himself, and take his
   cross day after day and follow me.

   ^24For whoever wants to preserve his life will lose it, and whoever
   loses his life for me will preserve it.

   ^25What good does it do a man to gain the whole world and lose or
   forfeit himself?

   ^26For if anyone is ashamed of me and my teaching the Son of Man will
   be ashamed of him, when he comes with all the glory of his Father and
   of the holy angels.

   ^27I tell you, some of you who stand here will certainly live to see
   the Kingdom of God!"

   ^28It was about eight days after Jesus said this that he took Peter,
   John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.

   ^29And as he was praying, the look of his face changed and his clothes
   turned dazzling white.

   ^30And two men were talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah,

   ^31and they appeared in glory and spoke of his departure which he was
   to go through with at Jerusalem.

   ^32Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep, but waking up
   they saw his glorious appearance and the two men standing by him.

   ^33Just as they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus,

   "Master, how good it is that we are here! Let us put up three huts, one
   for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah!" For he did not know what
   he was saying.

   ^34But as he said it, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were
   frightened as they passed under the cloud.

   ^35And from the cloud came a voice that said,

   "This is my Son, my Chosen! Listen to him!"

   ^36At the sound of the voice, they saw that Jesus was alone. And they
   kept silence, and said nothing about it to anyone at that time.

   ^37The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, it happened
   that a great crowd met him.

   ^38And a man in the crowd shouted,

   "Master, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child,

   ^39and all at once a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and
   it convulses him until he foams at the mouth, and it leaves him, after
   a struggle, badly bruised.

   ^40And I begged your disciples to drive it out, and they could not."

   ^41Jesus answered,

   "O you unbelieving, obstinate people! How long must I be with you and
   put up with you? Bring your son here!"

   ^42Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him down and
   convulsed him, but Jesus reproved the foul spirit and cured the boy and
   gave him back to his father.

   ^43And they were all amazed at the power of God.

   While everybody was full of wonder at all that he was doing, he said to
   his disciples,

   ^44"You must store up these teachings in your minds, for the Son of Man
   is going to be handed over to men."

   ^45But they did not understand what he meant, indeed it was concealed
   from them, in order that they might not comprehend it, and they were
   afraid to ask him what he meant.

   ^46A discussion arose among them as to which of them would be the
   greatest.

   ^47But Jesus knew the question that was in their minds and he took a
   child and made him stand by his side,

   ^48and said to them,

   "Whoever welcomes this child on my account is welcoming me, and whoever
   welcomes me, welcomes him who has sent me. For it is the lowliest among
   you all who is really great."

   ^49John answered,

   "Master, we saw a man driving out demons with your name, and we told
   him not to do so, for he does not go with us."

   ^50Jesus said to him,

   "Do not try to stop him, for the man who is not against you is for
   you."

   ^51As the time approached when he was to be taken up to heaven, he set
   his face toward Jerusalem,

   ^52and sent messengers before him. They started out and went into a
   Samaritan village, to make preparations for him.

   ^53And the people there would not receive him, because he was going to
   Jerusalem.

   ^54When the disciples, James and John, saw this, they said,

   "Master, will you have us order fire to come down from heaven and
   consume them?"

   ^55But he turned and reproved them.

   ^56And they went on to another village.

   ^57As they were going along the road, a man said to him,

   "I will follow you wherever you go."

   ^58Jesus said to him,

   "Foxes have holes, and wild birds have nests, but the Son of Man has
   nowhere to lay his head!"

   ^59He said to another,

   "Follow me."

   But he said,

   "Let me first go and bury my father."

   ^60Jesus said to him,

   "Leave the dead to bury their own dead; you must go and spread the news
   of the Kingdom of God!"

   ^61Yet another man said to him,

   "Master, I am going to follow you, but let me first say goodbye to my
   people at home."

   ^62Jesus said to him,

   "No one who puts his hand to the plough, and then looks back, is fitted
   for the Kingdom of God."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1After this the Master appointed seventy-two others, and sent them on
   before him, two by two, to every town or place to which he intended to
   come.

   ^2And he said to them,

   "The harvest is abundant enough, but the reapers are few. So pray to
   the owner of the harvest to send reapers to gather it.

   ^3Now go. Here I send you out like lambs among wolves.

   ^4Carry no purse nor wallet nor shoes, and do not stop to exchange
   civilities with anyone on the way.

   ^5Whenever you go to stay at a house, first say, Peace to this
   household!'

   ^6If there is anyone there who loves peace, your blessing will rest
   upon him, but if there is not, it will come back to you.

   ^7Stay at the same house, eating and drinking what they offer you, for
   the workman deserves his pay. Do not change from one house to another.

   ^8Whenever you come to a town and they welcome you, eat what is offered
   you,

   ^9and cure the sick there, and say to them, The Kingdom of God is close
   upon you!'

   ^10But whenever you come to a town and they do not welcome you, go out
   into the open streets and say,

   ^11The very dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off in
   protest. But understand this: the Kingdom of God is at hand!'

   ^12I tell you, on that Day Sodom will fare better than that town!

   ^13Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if the wonders
   that have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would
   have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes!

   ^14But Tyre and Sidon will fare better than you at the Judgment!

   ^15And you, Capernaum! Are you to be exalted to the skies? You will go
   down among the dead!

   ^16Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever disregards you
   disregards me, and whoever disregards me disregards him who sent me."

   ^17The seventy-two came back delighted, and said,

   "Master, when we use your name the very demons submit to us!"

   ^18He said to them,

   "I saw Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning!

   ^19Here I have given you the power to tread on snakes and scorpions,
   and to trample on all the power of the enemy. Nothing will hurt you at
   all.

   ^20But do not be glad that the spirits submit to you, but be glad that
   your names are enrolled in heaven."

   ^21At that moment he was inspired with joy, and said,

   "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding all this
   from the learned and intelligent, and revealing it to children! Yes, I
   thank you, Father, for choosing to have it so!

   ^22Everything has been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows
   who the Son is but the Father, nor who the Father is but the Son, and
   anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."

   ^23And he turned to his disciples when they were alone, and said,

   "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!

   ^24For I tell you, many prophets and kings have wished to see what you
   see, and could not see it, and to hear what you hear, and could not
   hear it!"

   ^25Then an expert in the Law got up to test him and said,

   "Master, what must I do to make sure of eternal life?"

   ^26Jesus said to him,

   "What does the Law say? How does it read?"

   ^27He answered,

   " You must love the Lord your God with your whole heart, your whole
   soul, your whole strength, and your whole mind,' and your neighbor as
   you do yourself.' "

   ^28Jesus said to him,

   "You are right. Do that, and you will live."

   ^29But he, wishing to justify his question, said,

   "And who is my neighbor?"

   ^30Jesus replied,

   "A man was on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into
   the hands of robbers, and they stripped him and beat him and went off
   leaving him half dead.

   ^31Now a priest happened to be going that way, and when he saw him, he
   went by on the other side of the road.

   ^32And a Levite also came to the place, and when he saw him, he went by
   on the other side.

   ^33But a Samaritan who was traveling that way came upon him, and when
   he saw him he pitied him,

   ^34and he went up to him and dressed his wounds with oil and wine and
   bound them up. And he put him on his own mule and brought him to an inn
   and took care of him.

   ^35The next day he took out a dollar and gave it to the innkeeper and
   said, Take care of him, and whatever more you spend I will refund to
   you on my way back.'

   ^36Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to the
   man who fell into the robbers' hands?"

   ^37He said,

   "The man who took pity on him."

   Jesus said to him,

   "Go and do so yourself!"

   ^38As they continued their journey, he came to a certain village, and a
   woman named Martha welcomed him to her house.

   ^39She had a sister named Mary, who seated herself at the Master's
   feet, and listened to what he was saying.

   ^40But Martha was worried with all she had to do for them, and she came
   up and said,

   "Master, does it make no difference to you that my sister has left me
   to do all the work alone? Tell her to help me."

   ^41The Master answered,

   "Martha, Martha, you are worried and anxious about many things,

   ^42but our wants are few, indeed there is only one thing we need. For
   Mary has chosen the right thing, and it must not be taken away from
   her."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1Once as he was praying in a certain place, when he stopped, one of
   his disciples said to him,

   "Master, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."

   ^2He said to them,

   "When you pray, say, Father, your name be revered! Your kingdom come!

   ^3Give us each day our bread for the day,

   ^4and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive anyone who wrongs
   us; and do not subject us to temptation.' "

   ^5And he said to them,

   "Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him in the middle of the
   night, and says to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,

   ^6for a friend of mine has just come to my house after a journey, and I
   have nothing for him to eat,'

   ^7and he answers from inside, Do not bother me; the door is now
   fastened, and my children and I have gone to bed; I cannot get up and
   give you any.'

   ^8I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him some because he
   is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rouse himself and
   give him all he needs.

   ^9So I tell you, ask, and what you ask will be given you. Search, and
   you will find what you search for. Knock, and the door will open to
   you.

   ^10For it is always the one who asks who receives, and the one who
   searches who finds, and the one who knocks to whom the door opens.

   ^11Which of you fathers, if his son asks him for a fish will give him a
   snake instead?

   ^12Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?

   ^13So if you, bad as you are, know enough to give your children what is
   good, how much more surely will your Father in heaven give the holy
   Spirit to those who ask him for it!"

   ^14Once he was driving out a dumb demon, and when the demon was gone
   the dumb man spoke. And the people were amazed.

   ^15But some of them said,

   "It is with the aid of Beelzebub, the prince of the demons, that he
   drives the demons out."

   ^16Others to test him asked him for a sign from heaven.

   ^17But he knew what they were thinking, and he said to them,

   "Any kingdom that is disunited is on the way to destruction, and one
   house falls after another.

   ^18And if Satan is disunited, how can his kingdom last? Because you say
   that I drive out demons with Beelzebub's aid.

   ^19But if it is with his aid that I drive out demons, by whose do your
   sons drive them out? Therefore, they shall be your judges.

   ^20But if it is with the finger of God that I am driving the demons
   out, then the Kingdom of God has overtaken you.

   ^21When a strong man fully armed guards his own dwelling, his property
   is undisturbed.

   ^22But when somebody stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he
   strips him of the arms that he relied on, and divides up the spoils.

   ^23Anyone who is not with me is against me, and anyone who does not
   join me in gathering, scatters.

   ^24When a foul spirit goes out of a man, it roams through deserts in
   search of rest, and when it finds none, it says, I will go back to my
   house that I left.'

   ^25And it goes and finds it unoccupied, cleaned, and all in order.

   ^26Then it goes and gets seven other spirits more wicked than itself,
   and they go in and live there, and in the end the man is worse off than
   he was before."

   ^27As he said this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to
   him,

   "Blessed is the mother who bore you and nursed you!"

   ^28But he said,

   "You might better say, Blessed are those who hear God's message and
   observe it!' "

   ^29As the crowds pressed a round him, he went on to say,

   "This is a wicked age! It demands a sign, and no sign will be given it
   but the sign of Jonah.

   ^30For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son
   of Man will be a sign to this age.

   ^31The queen of the south will rise with the men of this generation at
   the Judgment and will condemn them, for she came from the very ends of
   the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and there is more than Solomon
   here!

   ^32Men of Nineveh will rise with this generation at the Judgment and
   will condemn it, for they repented at Jonah's preaching, and there is
   more than Jonah here.

   ^33No one lights a lamp and puts it in the cellar or under a peck
   measure; he puts it on its stand, so that people who come in can see
   the light.

   ^34Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is sound, your
   whole body is light, but when it is unsound, your body is dark.

   ^35So take care! Your very light may be darkness!

   ^36If, therefore, your whole body is light with no darkness in it at
   all, it will all be as light as a lamp makes things for you by its
   light."

   ^37When he said this, a Pharisee asked him to lunch with him, and he
   went to his house and took his place at table.

   ^38The Pharisee noticed that he did not wash before the meal, and he
   was surprised.

   ^39But the Master said to him,

   "You Pharisees clean the outside of cups and dishes, but inside you are
   full of greed and wickedness.

   ^40You fools! Did not the Creator of the outside make the inside too?

   ^41But give your inmost life as charity, and you will immediately find
   everything clean.

   ^42But alas for you Pharisees! For you pay tithes on mint, rue, and
   every tiny herb, and disregard justice and the love of God. But you
   should have observed these, without neglecting the others.

   ^43Alas for you Pharisees! For you love to have the front seat in the
   synagogues and to be saluted with respect in public places.

   ^44Alas for you! For you are like unmarked graves which men tread upon
   without knowing it."

   ^45At this, one of the experts in the Law said to him,

   "Master, when you say that, you affront us too."

   ^46But he said,

   "Yes, alas for you experts in the Law too! For you load men with
   burdens they can hardly carry, and you will not touch them yourselves
   with a single finger.

   ^47Alas for you! For you build monuments for the prophets, whom your
   forefathers killed.

   ^48So you testify to what your fathers did and approve it, for they
   killed them and you build their monuments.

   ^49This is why the Wisdom of God said, I will send prophets and
   apostles to them, and some of them they will kill and some they will
   persecute'--

   ^50so that this age may be charged with the blood of all the prophets
   that has been shed since the creation of the world,

   ^51from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished
   between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you! This age will be
   charged with it all!

   ^52Alas for you experts in the Law! For you have taken the key to the
   door of knowledge, but you have not entered it yourselves, and you have
   kept out those who tried to enter."

   ^53After he left the house, the scribes and the Pharisees began to
   watch him closely and to try to draw him out on many subjects,

   ^54plotting to entrap him in something he might say.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1Meanwhile as the people gathered in thousands, until they actually
   trod on one another, he proceeded to say to his disciples first of all,

   "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, that is, hypocrisy.

   ^2There is nothing covered up that is not going to be uncovered, nor
   secret that is not going to be known.

   ^3For what you say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what
   you whisper in someone's ear, behind closed doors, will be proclaimed
   from the housetops.

   ^4I tell you, who are my friends, have no fear of those who kill the
   body, and after that can do no more.

   ^5I will show you whom to fear: fear him who, after killing you, has
   power to hurl you into the pit. Yes, fear him, I tell you.

   ^6Do not sparrows sell five for two cents? And yet not one of them is
   forgotten in God's sight.

   ^7But the very hairs on your heads are all counted! You must not be
   afraid, you are worth more than a great many sparrows!

   ^8I tell you, everyone who will acknowledge me before men, the Son of
   Man will acknowledge before the angels of God,

   ^9but anyone who disowns me before men will be disowned before the
   angels of God.

   ^10And anyone who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven for
   it, but no one who reviles the holy Spirit will be forgiven.

   ^11When they bring you before the synagogues or the magistrates or the
   authorities, you must have no anxiety about how to defend yourselves or
   what to say,

   ^12for at the very moment the holy Spirit will teach you what you ought
   to say."

   ^13Someone in the crowd said to him,

   "Master, tell my brother to give me my share of our inheritance."

   ^14But he said to him,

   "Who made me a judge or arbitrator of your affairs?"

   ^15And he said to them,

   "Take care! You must be on your guard against any form of greed, for a
   man's life does not belong to him, no matter how rich he is."

   ^16And he told them this story:

   "A certain rich man's lands yielded heavily.

   ^17And he said to himself, What am I going to do, for I have nowhere to
   store my crops?'

   ^18Then he said, This is what I will do; I will tear down my barns and
   build larger ones, and in them I will store all my grain and my goods.

   ^19And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have great wealth stored up
   for years to come. Now take your ease; eat, drink, and enjoy yourself."
   '

   ^20But God said to him, You fool! This very night your soul will be
   demanded of you. Then who will have all you have prepared?'

   ^21That is the way with the man who lays up money for himself, and is
   not rich with God."

   ^22And he said to his disciples,

   "Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about life, wondering what you
   will have to eat, or about your body, wondering what you will have to
   wear.

   ^23Life is more important than food, and the body than clothes.

   ^24Think of the crows! They do not sow or reap, and they have no
   storehouses or barns, and God feeds them. How much more you are worth
   than the birds!

   ^25Which of you with all his worry can add a single hour to his life?

   ^26So if you cannot do the least good, why should you worry about the
   rest?

   ^27See how the lilies grow. They do not toil or spin, but, I tell you,
   even Solomon in all his splendor was never dressed like one of them.

   ^28But if God so dresses the wild grass, which is alive today, and is
   thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more surely will he clothe
   you, who have so little faith?

   ^29So you must not ask what you are to have to eat or drink, and you
   must not be anxious about it.

   ^30For these are all things the nations of the world are in pursuit of,
   and your Father knows well that you need them.

   ^31But you must strive to find his kingdom, and you will have these
   other things besides.

   ^32Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen to give
   you the kingdom.

   ^33Sell what belongs to you, and give away the money! Get yourselves
   purses that will never wear out, inexhaustible riches in heaven, where
   thieves cannot get near nor moths destroy.

   ^34For wherever your treasure is, your heart will be too.

   ^35You must be ready with your lamps burning,

   ^36like men waiting for their master to come home from a wedding, so
   that when he comes and knocks, they can open the door for him at once.

   ^37Blessed are the slaves whom their master will find on the watch when
   he comes. I tell you, he will gird up his robe and make them take their
   places at table, and go around and wait on them.

   ^38Whether he comes late at night or early in the morning and finds
   them on the watch, they are blessed.

   ^39But you may be sure of this, that if the master of the house had
   known what time the thief was coming, he would have been on the watch,
   and would not have let his house be broken into.

   ^40You must be ready too, for the Son of Man is coming at a time when
   you do not expect him."

   ^41Peter said to him,

   "Master, do you mean this figure for us, or is it for everybody?"

   ^42And the Master said,

   "Who then will be the faithful, thoughtful manager, whom his master
   will put in charge of his household, to give the members of it their
   supplies at the proper time?

   ^43Blessed is that slave if his master when he returns finds him doing
   it.

   ^44I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his property.

   ^45But if the slave says to himself, My master is not coming back for a
   long time,' and begins to beat the men and women slaves and to eat and
   drink and get drunk,

   ^46that slave's master will come back some day when he does not expect
   him, and at some time of which he does not know, and will cut him in
   two, and put him with the unbelievers.

   ^47The slave who knows his master's wishes, but does not get ready or
   act upon them, will be severely punished.

   ^48But one who does wrong without knowing them will be lightly
   punished. From anyone who has been given much, much will be required,
   and of the man to whom people have intrusted much, they will demand
   even more.

   ^49I have come to bring fire down to the earth, and how I wish it were
   kindled already!

   ^50I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am till it is
   over!

   ^51Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth? Not peace, I
   tell you, but discord!

   ^52For from now on if there are five people in a house they will be
   divided three against two and two against three.

   ^53Father will be against son, and son against father, mother against
   daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her
   daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."

   ^54And he said to the crowds,

   "When you see a cloud rise in the west, you say at once, It is going to
   rain,' and it does.

   ^55And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, It is going to be
   very hot,' and it is.

   ^56You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the look of the earth and
   sky; and why can you not interpret this present time?

   ^57Why do you not decide what is right yourselves?

   ^58For when you are going before the magistrate with your opponent, do
   your best on the way to get rid of him, or he may hurry you off to the
   judge and the judge hand you over to the constable and the constable
   throw you into prison.

   ^59I tell you, you will never get out again until you have paid the
   last cent!"

  Chapter 13

   ^1Just then some people came up to bring him word of the Galileans
   whose blood Pilate had mingled with that of their sacrifices.

   ^2And he answered,

   "Do you think, because this happened to them, that these Galileans were
   worse sinners than any other Galileans?

   ^3No, I tell you; unless you repent, you will all perish as they did!

   ^4Or those eighteen people at Siloam who were killed when the tower
   fell upon them--do you think they were worse offenders than all the
   other people who live in Jerusalem?

   ^5No, I tell you; unless you repent, you will all perish as they did!"

   ^6He used this figure:

   "A man had a fig tree growing in his garden, and he went to look for
   fruit on it, and could not find any.

   ^7And he said to the gardener, Here I have come three years to look for
   fruit on this fig tree, without finding any. Cut it down. Why should it
   waste the ground?'

   ^8He answered, Let it stand this one year more, sir, till I dig around
   it and manure it;

   ^9perhaps it will bear fruit next year. But if it does not, you can
   have it cut down.' "

   ^10One Sabbath he was teaching in one of the synagogues,

   ^11and there was a woman there who for eighteen years had had a
   sickness caused by a spirit. She was bent double and could not
   straighten herself up at all.

   ^12When Jesus saw her he called to her,

   "You are freed from your sickness!"

   ^13And he laid his hands on her, and she instantly became erect, and
   praised God.

   ^14But the leader of the synagogue, in his vexation because Jesus had
   cured her on the Sabbath, spoke out and said to the crowd,

   "There are six days on which it is right to work. Come on them and be
   cured, but not on the Sabbath day."

   ^15But the Master answered,

   "You hypocrites! Does not every one of you untie his ox or his donkey
   from the stall on the Sabbath and lead him away to water him?

   ^16And did not this woman, who is a descendant of Abraham, whom Satan
   has kept bound for eighteen years, have to be released from those bonds
   on the Sabbath day?"

   ^17When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, and all the
   people were delighted at all the splendid things that he did.

   ^18He said, therefore,

   "What is the Kingdom of God like, and to what can I compare it?

   ^19It is like a mustard seed that a man took and dropped in his garden,
   and it grew and became a tree, and the wild birds roosted on its
   branches."

   ^20And he went on,

   "To what can I compare the Kingdom of God?

   ^21It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in a bushel of flour,
   till it all rose."

   ^22So he went about among the towns and villages, teaching and making
   his way toward Jerusalem.

   ^23And someone said to him,

   "Are only a few to be saved, Master?"

   He said to them,

   ^24"You must strain every nerve to get in through the narrow door, for
   I tell you many will try to get in, and will not succeed,

   ^25when the master of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you
   begin to stand outside and to knock on the door, and say, Open it for
   us, sir!' Then he will answer you and say, I do not know where you come
   from,'

   ^26Then you will go on to say, We have been entertained with you, and
   you have taught in our streets!'

   ^27And he will say to you, I do not know where you come from. Get away
   from me, all you wrongdoers!'

   ^28There you will weep and gnash your teeth when you see Abraham and
   Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, while you
   are put outside.

   ^29People will come from the east and west and the north and south, and
   take their places in the Kingdom of God.

   ^30There are those now last who will then be first, and there are those
   now first who will be last."

   ^31Just then some Pharisees came up and said to him,

   "Go! Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you!"

   ^32He said to them,

   "Go and say to that fox, Here I am, driving out demons and performing
   cures, today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will be through.

   ^33But I must go on today and tomorrow and the next day, for it is not
   right for a prophet to die outside Jerusalem.'

   ^34O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! murdering the prophets, and stoning those
   who are sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children
   around me, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you refused!

   ^35Now I leave you to yourselves. And I tell you, you will never see me
   again until you say, Blessed be he who comes in the Lord's name!' "
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   ^1One Sabbath, when he went to take a meal at the house of a member of
   the council who was a Pharisee, they were watching him closely.

   ^2There was a man in front of him who had dropsy.

   ^3And Jesus said to the Pharisees and the experts in the Law,

   "Is it right to cure people on the Sabbath or not?"

   ^4But they made no answer. And he took hold of the man and cured him
   and sent him away.

   ^5Then he said to them,

   "Who among you, if his child or his ox falls into a well, will not pull
   him out at once on the Sabbath?"

   ^6And they could make no reply to this.

   ^7He noticed that the guests picked out the best places, and he gave
   them this illustration:

   ^8"When someone invites you to a wedding supper, do not take the best
   place, for someone more distinguished than you are may have been
   invited,

   ^9and your host will come and say to you Make room for this man,' and
   then you will proceed in confusion to take the poorest place.

   ^10But when you are invited anywhere, go and take the poorest place, so
   that when your host comes in, he will say to you, My friend, come to a
   better place.' So you will be shown consideration before all the other
   guests.

   ^11For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the man who
   humbles himself will be exalted."

   ^12And he said to the man who had invited him,

   "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or
   your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors, for then they
   will invite you in return and you will be repaid.

   ^13But when you give an entertainment, invite people who are poor,
   maimed, lame, or blind.

   ^14Then you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you
   will be repaid at the resurrection of the upright."

   ^15One of the other guests heard this, and said to him,

   "Blessed is the man who shall be at the banquet in the Kingdom of God!"

   ^16He said to him,

   "A man once gave a great dinner, and invited a large number to it,

   ^17and when the dinner hour came, he sent around his slave, to say to
   those who were invited, Come! for it is now ready!'

   ^18And they all immediately began to excuse themselves. The first one
   said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I must go and look at
   it. Please have me excused.'

   ^19Another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to
   examine them. Please have me excused.'

   ^20Another said, I have married, and so I cannot come.'

   ^21So the slave went back, and reported this to his master. Then the
   master of the house was angry and said to his slave, Hurry out into the
   streets and squares of the city, and bring the poor, the maimed, the
   blind, and the lame in here!'

   ^22And the slave said, What you ordered, sir, has been done, and there
   is still room.'

   ^23And the master said to the slave, Go out on the roads, and among the
   hedges, and make them come in so that my house may be full.

   ^24For I tell you that none of those men who were invited shall have
   any of my dinner!' "

   ^25There were great crowds accompanying him, and once he turned and
   said to them,

   ^26"If anyone comes to me without hating his own father and mother and
   wife and children and brothers and sisters, and his very life too, he
   cannot be a disciple of mine.

   ^27For no one who does not take up his own cross and come after me can
   be a disciple of mine.

   ^28What man among you if he wishes to build a tower does not first sit
   down and estimate the cost of it, to see whether he has enough to
   complete it?

   ^29Or else when he has laid his foundation and cannot finish the
   building, everyone who sees it will begin to ridicule him,

   ^30and say, This man started to erect a building, and could not finish
   it!'

   ^31Or what king, if he is going to meet another king in battle, does
   not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand
   men to meet the other who is coming against him with twenty thousand?

   ^32And if he cannot, while the other is still far away, he sends envoys
   to him and asks on what terms he will make peace.

   ^33In just that way, no one of you who does not say goodbye to all he
   has can be a disciple of mine.

   ^34Salt is good; but if salt loses its strength, what can it be
   seasoned with?

   ^35It is fit neither for the ground nor the manure heap; people throw
   it away. Let him who has ears to hear with, listen!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   ^1All the tax-collectors and irreligious people were crowding up to
   hear him.

   ^2And the Pharisees and scribes grumbled, and said,

   "This man welcomes irreligious people, and even eats with them!"

   ^3So in speaking to them he used this figure:

   ^4"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep, and loses one of
   them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go in
   search of the one that is lost, until he finds it?

   ^5And when he finds it, he puts it on his shoulders with joy,

   ^6and when he reaches home, he calls in his friends and neighbors, and
   says to them, Congratulate me, for I have found my lost sheep!'

   ^7I tell you, in just that way there will be more joy in heaven over
   one sinful person who repents, than over ninety-nine upright people who
   do not need any repentance.

   ^8Or what woman who has ten silver coins and loses one, does not light
   the lamp and sweep the house and look carefully until she finds it?

   ^9And when she finds it, she calls in her friends and neighbors, and
   says to them, Congratulate me, for I have found the coin that I lost!'

   ^10In just that way, I tell you, there is joy among the angels of God
   over one sinful person who repents!"

   ^11And he said,

   "A man had two sons.

   ^12The younger of them said to his father, Father, give me my share of
   the property.' So he divided his property between them.

   ^13Not many days later, the younger son gathered up all he had, and
   went away to a distant country, and there he squandered his property by
   fast living.

   ^14After he had spent it all, a severe famine arose in that country,
   and he began to be in want.

   ^15And he went and hired himself out to a resident of the country, and
   he sent him into his fields to tend pigs.

   ^16And he was ready to fill himself with the pods the pigs were eating,
   and no one would give him anything.

   ^17When he came to himself he said, How many hired men my father has,
   who have more than enough to eat, and here I am, dying of hunger!

   ^18I will get up, and go to my father, and say to him, "Father, I have
   sinned against heaven and in your eyes;

   ^19I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me like one of your
   hired men!" '

   ^20And he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long
   way off, his father saw him, and pitied him, and ran and fell on his
   neck, and kissed him.

   ^21His son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in
   your eyes; I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me like one
   of your hired men!'

   ^22But his father said to his slaves, Make haste and get out the best
   robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his
   feet;

   ^23and get the calf we are fattening, and kill it, and let us feast and
   celebrate,

   ^24for my son here was dead, and he has come to life; he was lost, and
   he is found!' So they began to celebrate.

   ^25But his elder son was in the field. When he came in and approached
   the house, he heard music and dancing,

   ^26and he called one of the servants to him and asked him what it
   meant.

   ^27He said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed
   the calf he has been fattening, because he has gotten him back alive
   and well.'

   ^28But he was angry and would not go into the house. And his father
   came out and urged him.

   ^29And he said to his father, Here I have served you all these years,
   and have never disobeyed an order of yours, and you have never given me
   a kid, so that I could entertain my friends.

   ^30But when your son here came, who has eaten up your property with
   women of the street, for him you killed the calf you have been
   fattening!'

   ^31But he said to him, My child, you have been with me all the time,
   and everything I have is yours.

   ^32But we had to celebrate and be glad, because your brother was dead,
   and has come to life, and was lost and is found!' "
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   ^1And he said to his disciples,

   "There was a rich man who had a manager, and it was reported to him
   that this man was squandering his property.

   ^2So he called him in and said to him, What is this that I hear about
   you? Make an accounting for your conduct of my affairs, for you cannot
   be manager any longer!'

   ^3Then the manager said to himself, What am I going to do, because my
   master is going to take my position away from me? I cannot dig; I am
   ashamed to beg.

   ^4I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from my position
   people will take me into their homes.'

   ^5Then he called in each of his master's debtors, and he said to the
   first one, How much do you owe my master?'

   ^6He said, Eight hundred gallons of oil.' And he said to him, Here is
   your agreement; sit right down and write four hundred!'

   ^7Then he said to another, And how much do you owe?' He answered,
   Fifteen hundred bushels of wheat.' He said to him, Here is your
   agreement; write twelve hundred.'

   ^8And his master praised the dishonest manager, because he had acted
   shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder in their relation to
   their own age than the sons of the light.

   ^9So I tell you, make friends for yourselves with your ill-gotten
   wealth, so that when it fails, they may take you into the eternal
   dwellings.

   ^10The man who can be trusted in a very small matter can be trusted in
   a large one, and the man who cannot be trusted in a very small matter
   cannot be trusted in a large one.

   ^11So if you have proved untrustworthy in using your ill-gotten wealth,
   who will trust you with true riches?

   ^12And if you have been untrustworthy about what belonged to someone
   else, who will give you what belongs to you?

   ^13No servant can belong to two masters, for he will either hate one
   and love the other, or he will stand by one and make light of the
   other. You cannot serve God and money!"

   ^14The Pharisees, who were avaricious, heard all this, and they
   ridiculed him.

   ^15And he said to them,

   "You are the men who parade your uprightness before people, but God
   knows your hearts. For what men consider great is detestable in the
   sight of God.

   ^16Until John came, it was the Law and the Prophets. From that time the
   Kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone has been crowding into
   it.

   ^17But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one
   dotting of an i in the Law to go unfulfilled.

   ^18Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits
   adultery, and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced from her
   husband commits adultery.

   ^19"There was once a rich man, who used to dress in purple and fine
   linen, and to live in luxury every day.

   ^20And a beggar named Lazarus was put down at his gate covered with
   sores

   ^21and eager to satisfy his hunger with what was thrown away from the
   rich man's table. Why, the very dogs came and licked his sores.

   ^22And it came about that the beggar died and was carried away by the
   angels to the companionship of Abraham, and the rich man too died and
   was buried.

   ^23And in Hades he looked up, tormented as he was, and saw Abraham far
   away, with Lazarus beside him.

   ^24And he called to him and said, Father Abraham! take pity on me, and
   send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue,
   for I am in torment, here in the flames!'

   ^25And Abraham said, My child, remember that you received your
   blessings in your lifetime, and Lazarus had his misfortunes in his; and
   now he is being comforted here, while you are in anguish.

   ^26Besides there is a great chasm set between you and us, so that those
   who want to go over from this side to you cannot, and they cannot cross
   from your side to us.'

   ^27And he said, Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's
   house,

   ^28for I have five brothers; let him warn them so that they will not
   also come to this place of torture.'

   ^29Abraham answered, They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen
   to them.'

   ^30But he said, No! Father Abraham, but if someone will go to them from
   the dead, they will repent!'

   ^31He answered, If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, they
   will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead!' "
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   ^1And he said to his disciples,

   "It is inevitable that hindrances should arise, but alas for the man
   who causes them!

   ^2He might better have a millstone hung around his neck, and be thrown
   into the sea, than be a hindrance to one of these humble people.

   ^3Look out for yourselves! If your brother wrongs you, take it up with
   him, and if he repents, forgive him.

   ^4And if he wrongs you seven times a day, and seven times turns to you
   and says, I am sorry,' you must forgive him."

   ^5The apostles said to the Master, "Give us more faith."

   ^6And the Master said,

   "If your faith is as big as a mustard seed, you might have said to this
   mulberry tree, Be pulled up by the roots and planted in the sea,' and
   it would have obeyed you!

   ^7"What man among you, if he has a servant ploughing or keeping sheep,
   will say to him when he comes in from the field, Come at once and sit
   down at the table,'

   ^8instead of saying to him, Get my supper ready, and dress yourself,
   and wait on me while I eat and drink, and you can eat and drink
   afterward'?

   ^9Is he grateful to the slave for doing what he has been ordered to do?

   ^10So you also, when you do all you have been ordered to do, must say,
   We are good-for-nothing slaves! We have done only what we ought to have
   done!' "

   ^11It happened that, on his way to Jerusalem, he passed through Samaria
   and Galilee.

   ^12And as he was going into one village he met ten lepers, and they
   stood at some distance from him,

   ^13and raising their voices, said,

   "Jesus, Master, take pity on us!"

   ^14And when he saw them, he said to them,

   "Go and show yourselves to the priests."

   And as they went they were cured.

   ^15But one of them, when he saw that he was cured, came back, loudly
   praising God,

   ^16and fell on his face at Jesus' feet, and thanked him. He was a
   Samaritan.

   ^17And Jesus said,

   "Were not all ten cured? Where are the other nine?

   ^18Was no one found to return and give thanks to God except this
   foreigner?"

   ^19And he said to him,

   "Stand up and go! Your faith has cured you."

   ^20He was once asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would
   come, and he answered,

   "The Kingdom of God is not coming visibly,

   ^21and people will not say, Look! here it is!' or There it is!' for the
   Kingdom of God is within you."

   ^22And he said to his disciples,

   "The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the
   Son of Man, and you will not be able to do so.

   ^23Men will say to you, Look! There he is!' or, Look! Here he is!' Do
   not go off in pursuit of him,

   ^24for just as when the lightning flashes, it shines from one end of
   the sky to the other, that will be the way with the Son of Man.

   ^25But first he must go through much suffering, and be refused by this
   age.

   ^26In the time of the Son of Man it will be just as it was in the time
   of Noah.

   ^27People went on eating, drinking, marrying, and being married up to
   the very day that Noah got into the ark and the flood came and
   destroyed them all.

   ^28Or as it was in Lot's time; they went on eating, drinking, buying,
   selling, planting, and building,

   ^29but the day Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
   and destroyed them all.

   ^30It will be like that on the day when the Son of Man appears.

   ^31A man who is on the roof of his house that day, with his goods in
   the house, must not go down to get them, and a man in the field, too,
   must not turn back.

   ^32Remember Lot's wife!

   ^33Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it, and whoever loses
   his life will preserve it.

   ^34I tell you, there will be two men in the same bed that night; one
   will be taken and the other left.

   ^35There will be two women grinding together; one will be taken and the
   other left!"

   ^37They said to him,

   "Where will this be, Master?"

   And he said to them,

   "Wherever there is a dead body the vultures will flock!"

  Chapter 18

   ^1He gave them an illustration to show that they must always pray and
   not give up,

   ^2and he said,

   "There was once in a city a judge who had no fear of God and no respect
   for men.

   ^3There was a widow in the city and she came to him and said, Protect
   me from my opponent.'

   ^4And he would not for a time, but afterward he said to himself, Though
   I have no fear of God nor respect for men,

   ^5yet because this widow bothers me, I will protect her, so that she
   may not finally wear me out with her coming.' "

   ^6And the Master said,

   "Listen to what this dishonest judge said!

   ^7Then will not God provide protection for his chosen people, who cry
   out to him day and night?

   ^8I tell you, he will make haste to provide it! But when the Son of Man
   comes, will he find faith on earth?"

   ^9To some who were confident of their own uprightness, and thought
   nothing of others, he used this illustration:

   ^10"Two men went up to the Temple to pray; one was a Pharisee and the
   other a tax-collector.

   ^11The Pharisee stood up and uttered this prayer to himself: O God, I
   thank you that I am not like other men, greedy, dishonest, or
   adulterous, like that tax-collector.

   ^12I fast two days in the week; I pay tithes on everything I get.'

   ^13But the tax-collector stood at a distance and would not even raise
   his eyes to heaven, but struck his breast, and said, O God, have mercy
   on a sinner like me!'

   ^14I tell you, it was he who went back to his house with God's
   approval, and not the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be
   humbled, but the man who humbles himself will be exalted."

   ^15People brought babies to him to have him touch them, but the
   disciples, when they saw it, reproved them for it.

   ^16But Jesus called them up to him and said,

   "Let the children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the
   Kingdom of God belongs to such as they.

   ^17I tell you, whoever does not accept the Kingdom of God like a child
   will not enter it at all."

   ^18A member of the council asked him,

   "Good master, what must I do to make sure of eternal life?"

   ^19Jesus said to him,

   "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God himself.

   ^20You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do
   not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.' "

   ^21And he said,

   "I have obeyed all these commandments ever since I was a child."

   ^22When Jesus heard this, he said to him,

   "There is one thing that you still lack. Sell all that you have, and
   divide the money among the poor, and then you will have riches in
   heaven; and come back and be a follower of mine."

   ^23But when he heard that, he was much cast down, for he was very rich.

   ^24And when Jesus saw it, he said,

   "How hard it will be for those who have money to get into the Kingdom
   of God!

   ^25It is easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for
   a rich man to get into the Kingdom of God!"

   ^26And those who heard it said,

   "Then who can be saved?"

   ^27And he said,

   "The things that are impossible for men are possible for God!"

   ^28Peter said,

   "Here we have left home and followed you."

   ^29And he said to them,

   "I tell you, there is no one who has given up home or wife or brothers
   or parents or children for the Kingdom of God

   ^30who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the coming
   age eternal life."

   ^31And he took the Twelve aside and said to them,

   "See! we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything written in the
   prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.

   ^32For he will be handed over to the heathen, and ridiculed and
   insulted and spat upon,

   ^33and they will flog him and kill him, and on the third day he will
   rise again."

   ^34And they did not understand any of this; the words were obscure to
   them, and they did not know what he meant.

   ^35As he approached Jericho, a blind man happened to be sitting by the
   roadside begging.

   ^36And hearing a crowd going by he asked what it meant.

   ^37They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was coming by.

   ^38And he shouted,

   "Jesus, you Son of David, take pity on me!"

   ^39And those who were in front reproved him and told him to be quiet,
   but he cried out all the louder,

   "You Son of David, take pity on me!"

   ^40And Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he
   came up, Jesus asked him,

   ^41"What do you want me to do for you?"

   He answered,

   "Master, let me regain my sight!"

   ^42And Jesus said to him,

   "Regain your sight! Your faith has cured you!"

   ^43And he regained his sight immediately, and followed Jesus, giving
   thanks to God. And all the people saw it and praised God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   ^1And he went into Jericho and was passing through it.

   ^2Now there was a man named Zaccheus, the principal tax-collector, a
   rich man,

   ^3who wanted to see who Jesus was, and he could not because of the
   crowd, for he was a small man.

   ^4So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree, to see him,
   for Jesus was coming that way.

   ^5When Jesus reached the place, he looked up and said to him,

   "Zaccheus, come down quickly! for I must stay at your house today."

   ^6And he came down quickly and welcomed him gladly.

   ^7And when they saw this, everyone complained, and said,

   "He has gone to stay with an irreligious man!"

   ^8But Zaccheus stopped and said to the Master,

   "See, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and if I have
   defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay him four times as much."

   ^9Jesus said to him,

   "Salvation has come to this house today, for he too is a descendant of
   Abraham.

   ^10For the Son of Man has come to search for what was lost and to save
   it."

   ^11As they were listening to this, Jesus went on to give them an
   illustration, because he was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the
   Kingdom of God was immediately going to appear.

   ^12So he said,

   "A nobleman once went to a distant country to secure his appointment to
   a kingdom and then return.

   ^13And he called in ten of his slaves and gave them each twenty dollars
   and told them to trade with it while he was gone.

   ^14But his countrymen hated him, and they sent a delegation after him
   to say, We do not want this man made king over us.'

   ^15And when he had secured the appointment and returned, he ordered the
   slaves to whom he had given the money to be called in, so that he could
   find out how much they had made.

   ^16The first one came in and said, Your twenty dollars has made two
   hundred, sir!'

   ^17And he said to him, Well done, my excellent slave! You have proved
   trustworthy about a very small amount, you shall be governor of ten
   towns.'

   ^18The second came in and said, Your twenty dollars has made a hundred,
   sir!'

   ^19And he said to him, And you shall be governor of five towns!'

   ^20And the other one came in and said, Here is your twenty dollars,
   sir. I have kept it put away in a handkerchief,

   ^21for I was afraid of you, for you are a stern man. You pick up what
   you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.'

   ^22He said to him, Out of your own mouth I will convict you, you
   wretched slave! You knew, did you, that I was a stern man, and that I
   pick up what I did not lay down, and harvest what I did not sow?

   ^23Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I came
   back I could have gotten it with interest?'

   ^24And he said to the bystanders, Take the twenty dollars away from
   him, and give it to the man who has the two hundred!'

   ^25They said to him, He has two hundred, sir!'--

   ^26I tell you, the man who has will have more given him, and from the
   man who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away!

   ^27But bring those enemies of mine here who did not want me made king
   over them, and slaughter them in my presence!' "

   ^28With these words he went on ahead of them, on his way to Jerusalem.

   ^29When he was near Bethphage and Bethany by the hill called the Mount
   of Olives, he sent two of his disciples

   ^30and said to them,

   "Go to the village that lies in front of you, and as you enter it you
   will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and
   bring it here.

   ^31And if anyone asks you why you are untying it, you are to say, The
   Master needs it.'

   ^32And the messengers went and found it just as he had told them.

   ^33And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them,

   "Why are you untying the colt?"

   ^34And they said,

   "The Master needs it!"

   ^35And they brought it to Jesus. And they threw their coats on the colt
   and mounted Jesus on it.

   ^36And as he went on, people spread their coats in the road.

   ^37Just as he was coming down the Mount of Olives and approaching the
   city, the whole throng of his disciples began to praise God loudly and
   joyfully, for all the wonders they had seen,

   ^38and to say,

   "Blessed is the king who comes in the Lord's name,

   Peace be in heaven and glory on high!"

   ^39Some Pharisees in the crowd said to him,

   "Master, reprove your disciples!"

   ^40And he answered,

   "I tell you, if they keep silence, the stones will cry out!"

   ^41As he approached the city and saw it, he wept over it,

   ^42and said,

   "If you yourself only knew today the conditions of peace! But as it is,
   they are hidden from you.

   ^43For a time is coming upon you when your enemies will throw up
   earthworks about you and surround you and shut you in on all sides,

   ^44and they will throw you and your children within you to the ground,
   and they will not leave one stone upon another within you because you
   did not know when God visited you!"

   ^45Then he went into the Temple and proceeded to drive out those who
   were selling things there,

   ^46and he said to them,

   "The Scripture says, And my house shall be a house of prayer,' but you
   have made it a den of robbers!"

   ^47Every day he taught in the Temple, and the high priests and scribes
   and the leading men of the people were trying to destroy him,

   ^48but they could not find any way to do it, for all the people hung
   upon his words.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 20

   ^1One day as he was teaching the people in the Temple, and preaching
   the good news, the high priests and scribes came up with the elders

   ^2and said to him,

   "Tell us what authority you have for doing as you do, or who gave you
   any such authority?"

   ^3He said to them,

   "I will ask you a question too.

   ^4Tell me, did John's baptism come from heaven or from men?"

   ^5And they argued with one another, and said,

   "If we say From heaven,' he will say, Why did you not believe him?'

   ^6But if we say, From men,' all the people will stone us to death, for
   they are convinced that John was a prophet."

   ^7So they answered that they did not know where it came from.

   ^8And Jesus said to them,

   "Nor will I tell you what authority I have for doing as I do."

   ^9Then he went on to give the people this illustration:

   "A man once planted a vineyard, and leased it to tenants, and went away
   for along absence.

   ^10And at the proper time he sent a slave to the tenants to have them
   give him a share of the vintage, but the tenants beat him, and sent him
   back empty-handed.

   ^11And again he sent another slave, and they beat him also and
   mistreated him and sent him back empty-handed.

   ^12And again he sent a third, but they wounded him too, and threw him
   outside.

   ^13Then the owner of the vineyard said, What can I do? I will send them
   my dear son; perhaps they will respect him.'

   ^14But when the tenants saw him, they argued with one another, This is
   his heir! Let us kill him, so that the property will belong to us!'

   ^15So they drove him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now what will
   the owner of the vineyard do to them?

   ^16He will come and put those tenants to death, and give the vineyard
   to others."

   When they heard this they said,

   "Heaven forbid!"

   ^17He looked at them and said,

   "Then what does this saying of Scripture mean,

   " That stone which the builders rejected

   Has become the cornerstone'?

   ^18Whoever falls on that stone will be shattered, but whoever it falls
   upon will be pulverized."

   ^19And the scribes and high priests wanted to arrest him then and
   there, but they were afraid of the people, for they knew that he had
   aimed this illustration at them.

   ^20So they kept watch of him and set some spies who pretended to be
   honest men to fasten on something that he said, so that they might hand
   him over to the control and authority of the governor.

   ^21And they asked him,

   "Master, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that
   you show no favor, but teach the way of God in sincerity.

   ^22Is it right for us to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?"

   ^23But he detected their trickery, and said to them,

   ^24"Show me a denarius. Whose head and title does it bear?"

   They said,

   "The emperor's."

   ^25He said to them,

   "Then pay the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and pay God what
   belongs to God!"

   ^26So they could not fasten on what he said before the people, and they
   were amazed at his answer, and said nothing more.

   ^27Then some of the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection,
   came up and asked him,

   ^28"Master, Moses made us a law that if a man's brother die leaving a
   wife but no children, the man should marry the widow and raise up a
   family for his brother.

   ^29Now there were seven brothers. And the eldest married a wife and
   died childless.

   ^30And the second married her,

   ^31and the third, and all the seven married her and died without
   leaving any child.

   ^32After ward the woman died too.

   ^33Now at the resurrection, which one's wife will the woman be? For all
   seven of them married her."

   ^34Jesus said to them,

   "The people of this world marry and are married,

   ^35but those who are thought worthy to attain that other world and the
   resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are married.

   ^36For they cannot die again; they are like the angels, and through
   sharing in the resurrection, they are sons of God.

   ^37But that the dead are raised to life, even Moses indicated in the
   passage about the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the
   God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'

   ^38He is not the God of dead men but of living, for all men are alive
   to him."

   ^39Some of the scribes replied,

   "Master, that was a fine answer!"

   ^40For they did not dare to ask him any more questions.

   ^41But he said to them,

   "How can the scribes say that the Christ is a son of David?

   ^42For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,

   " The Lord has said to my lord, "Sit at my right hand,

   ^43Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet!*#")

   ^44David then calls him lord. So how can he be his son?"

   ^45While all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,

   ^46"Beware of the scribes who like to go about in long robes, and love
   to be saluted with respect in public places, and to have the front
   seats in the synagogues and the best places at banquets--

   ^47men who eat up widows' houses and to cover it up make long prayers!
   They will get all the heavier sentence!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 21

   ^1And looking up, he saw the rich people dropping their gifts into the
   treasury.

   ^2And he saw a poor widow drop in two coppers.

   ^3And he said,

   "I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all the rest.

   ^4For they all gave from what they had to spare, but she in her want
   has put in all she had to live on."

   ^5When some spoke about the Temple and its decoration with costly stone
   and votive offerings, he said,

   ^6"As for all this that you are looking at, the time is coming when not
   one stone will be left here upon another that will not be torn down!"

   ^7Then they asked him,

   "Master, when will this happen, and what will be the sign that it is
   going to take place?"

   ^8And he said,

   "Take care not to be misled. For many will come under my name, and say,
   I am he,' and The time is at hand.' Do not follow them.

   ^9But when you hear of wars and outbreaks, do not be alarmed. These
   have to come first, but the end does not follow immediately."

   ^10Then he said to them,

   "Nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

   ^11There will be great earthquakes, and pestilence and famine here and
   there. There will be horrors and great signs in the sky.

   ^12But before all this, men will arrest you and persecute you, and hand
   you over to synagogues and prisons and have you brought before kings
   and governors on my account.

   ^13It will all lead to your testifying.

   ^14So make up your minds not to prepare your defense,

   ^15for I will give you such wisdom of utterance as none of your
   opponents will be able to resist or dispute.

   ^16You will be betrayed even by your parents and brothers and kinsmen
   and friends and they will put some of you to death,

   ^17and you will be hated by everyone because you bear my name.

   ^18Yet not a hair of your head will perish!

   ^19It is by your endurance that you will win your souls.

   ^20But when you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, then you must
   understand that her devastation is at hand.

   ^21Then those who are in Judea must fly to the hills, those who are in
   the city must get out of it, and those who are in the country must not
   go into it,

   ^22for those are the days of vengeance, when all that is written in the
   Scriptures will be fulfilled.

   ^23But alas for women who are with child at that time, or who have
   babies, for there will be great misery in the land and anger at this
   people.

   ^24They will fall by the edge of the sword, and be carried off as
   prisoners among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot
   by the heathen, until the time of the heathen comes.

   ^25There will be signs too in sun, moon, and stars, and on earth dismay
   among the heathen, bewildered at the roar of the sea and the waves.

   ^26Men will swoon with fear and foreboding of what is to happen to the
   world, for the forces in the sky will shake.

   ^27Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power
   and glory.

   ^28But when this begins to happen, look up and raise your heads, for
   your deliverance will be at hand."

   ^29And he gave them an illustration:

   "See the fig tree and all the trees.

   ^30As soon as they put out their leaves, you see them and you know
   without being told that summer is coming.

   ^31So when you see these things happen, you must know that the Kingdom
   of God is at hand.

   ^32I tell you, it will all happen before the present generation passes
   away.

   ^33Earth and sky will pass away, but my words will not.

   ^34But take care that your hearts are not loaded down with
   self-indulgence and drunkenness and worldly cares, and that day takes
   you by surprise, like a trap.

   ^35For it will come on all who are living anywhere on the face of the
   earth.

   ^36But you must be vigilant and always pray that you may succeed in
   escaping all this that is going to happen, and in standing in the
   presence of the Son of Man."

   ^37He would spend the days teaching in the Temple, but at night he
   would go out of the city and stay on the hill called the Mount of
   Olives.

   ^38And in the morning all the people would come to him in the Temple to
   listen to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 22

   ^1The festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was
   approaching.

   ^2And the high priests and the scribes were casting about for a way to
   put him to death, for they were afraid of the people.

   ^3But Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, a member of
   the Twelve.

   ^4And he went off and discussed with the high priests and captains of
   the Temple how he could betray him to them.

   ^5And they were delighted and agreed to pay him for it.

   ^6And he accepted their offer, and watched for an opportunity to betray
   him to them without a disturbance.

   ^7When the day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb had
   to be sacrificed,

   ^8Jesus sent Peter and John, saying to them,

   "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."

   ^9They said to him,

   "Where do you want us to prepare it?"

   ^10He said to them,

   "Just after you enter the city, you will meet a man carrying a pitcher
   of water. Follow him to the house to which he goes,

   ^11and say to the man of the house, Our Master says to you, "Where is
   the room where I can eat the Passover supper with my disciples?" '

   ^12And he will show you a large room upstairs with the necessary
   furniture. Make your preparations there."

   ^13So they went and found everything just as he had told them, and they
   prepared the Passover supper.

   ^14When the time came, he took his place at the table, with the
   apostles about him.

   ^15And he said to them,

   "I have greatly desired to eat this Passover supper with you before I
   suffer.

   ^16For I tell you, I will never eat one again until it reaches its
   fulfilment in the Kingdom of God."

   ^17And when he was handed a cup, he thanked God, and then said,

   "Take this and share it among you, for I tell you,

   ^18I will not drink the product of the vine again until the Kingdom of
   God comes."

   ^19And he took a loaf of bread and thanked God, and broke it in pieces,
   and gave it to them, saying,

   "This is my body.

   ^21Yet look! The hand of the man who is betraying me is beside me on
   the table!

   ^22For the Son of Man is going his way, as it has been decreed, but
   alas for the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!"

   ^23And they began to discuss with one another which of them it was who
   was going to do this.

   ^24A dispute also arose among them, as to which one of them ought to be
   considered the greatest.

   ^25But he said to them,

   "The kings of the heathen lord it over them, and their authorities are
   given the title of Benefactor.

   ^26But you are not to do so, but whoever is greatest among you must be
   like the youngest, and the leader like a servant.

   ^27For which is greater, the man at the table, or the servant who waits
   on him? Is not the man at the table? Yet I am like a servant among you.

   ^28But it is you who have stood by me in my trials.

   ^29So just as my Father has conferred a kingdom on me

   ^30I confer on you the right to eat and drink at my table in my
   kingdom, and to sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel!

   ^31O Simon, Simon! Satan has obtained permission to sift all of you
   like wheat,

   ^32but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail. And afterward
   you yourself must turn and strengthen your brothers."

   ^33Peter said to him,

   "Master, I am ready to go to prison and to death with you!"

   ^34But he said,

   "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow today before you deny three
   times that you know me!"

   ^35And he said to them,

   "When I sent you out without any purse or bag or shoes, was there
   anything you needed?"

   They said,

   "No, nothing."

   ^36He said to them,

   "But now, if a man has a purse let him take it, and a bag too. And a
   man who has no sword must sell his coat and buy one.

   ^37For I tell you that this saying of Scripture must find its
   fulfilment in me: He was rated an outlaw.' Yes, that saying about me is
   to be fulfilled!"

   ^38But they said,

   "See, Master, here are two swords!"

   And he said to them,

   "Enough of this!"

   ^39And he went out of the city and up on the Mount of Olives as he was
   accustomed to do, with his disciples following him.

   ^40And when he reached the spot, he said to them,

   "Pray that you may not be subjected to trial."

   ^41And he withdrew about a stone's throw from them, and kneeling down
   he prayed

   ^42and said,

   "Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. But not my
   will but yours be done!"

   ^45When he got up from his prayer, he went to the disciples and found
   them asleep from sorrow.

   ^46And he said to them,

   "Why are you asleep? Get up, and pray that you may not be subjected to
   trial!"

   ^47While he was still speaking, a crowd of people came up, with the man
   called Judas, one of the Twelve, at their head, and he stepped up to
   Jesus to kiss him.

   ^48Jesus said to him,

   "Would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"

   ^49Those who were about him saw what was coming and said,

   "Master, shall we use our swords?"

   ^50And one of them did strike at the high priest's slave and cut his
   right ear off.

   ^51But Jesus answered,

   "Let me do this much!"

   And he touched his ear and healed him.

   ^52And Jesus said to the high priests, captains of the Temple, and
   elders who had come to take him,

   "Have you come out with swords and clubs as though I were a robber?

   ^53When I was among you day after day in the Temple you never laid a
   hand on me! But you choose this hour, and the cover of darkness!"

   ^54Then they arrested him and led him away and took him to the house of
   the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance.

   ^55And they kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat about
   it, and Peter sat down among them.

   ^56A maid saw him sitting by the fire and looked at him and said,

   "This man was with him too."

   ^57But he denied it, and said,

   "I do not know him."

   ^58Shortly after, a man saw him and said,

   "You are one of them too!"

   But Peter said,

   "I am not!"

   ^59About an hour later, another man insisted,

   "This man was certainly with him too, for he is a Galilean!"

   ^60But Peter said,

   "I do not know what you mean."

   And immediately, just as he spoke, a cock crowed.

   ^61And the Master turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the
   words the Master had said to him--"Before the cock crows today, you
   will disown me three times."

   ^62And he went outside and wept bitterly.

   ^63The men who had Jesus in custody flogged him and made sport of him,

   ^64and they blindfolded him, and asked him,

   "Show that you are a prophet! Who was it that struck you?"

   ^65And they said many other abusive things to him.

   ^66As soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the high priests
   and scribes assembled, and brought him before their council, and said
   to him,

   ^67"If you are the Christ, tell us so."

   But he said to them,

   "If I tell you, you will not believe me,

   ^68and if I ask you a question, you will not answer me.

   ^69But from this time on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right
   hand of God Almighty!"

   ^70And they all said,

   "Are you the Son of God then?"

   And he said to them,

   "I am, as you say!"

   ^71Then they said,

   "What do we want of testimony now? We have heard it ourselves from his
   own mouth!"

  Chapter 23

   ^1Then they arose in a body and took him to Pilate,

   ^2and they made this charge against him:

   "Here is a man whom we have found misleading our nation, and forbidding
   the payment of taxes to the emperor, and claiming to be an anointed
   king himself."

   ^3And Pilate asked him,

   "Are you the king of the Jews?"

   He answered,

   "Yes."

   ^4And Pilate said to the high priests and the crowd,

   "I cannot find anything criminal about this man."

   ^5But they persisted and said,

   "He is stirring up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He began
   in Galilee and he has come here."

   ^6When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man were a Galilean

   ^7and learning that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction he turned him
   over to Herod, for Herod was in Jerusalem at that time.

   ^8When Herod saw Jesus he was delighted, for he had wanted for a long
   time to see him, because he had heard about him and he hoped to see
   some wonder done by him.

   ^9And he questioned him at some length, but he made him no answer.

   ^10Meanwhile the high priests and the scribes stood by and vehemently
   accused him.

   ^11And Herod and his guards made light of him and ridiculed him, and
   they put a gorgeous robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.

   ^12And Herod and Pilate became friends that day, for they had been at
   enmity before.

   ^13Pilate summoned the high priests and the leading members of the
   council and the people,

   ^14and said to them,

   "You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people, and
   here I have examined him before you and not found him guilty of any of
   the things that you accuse him of.

   ^15Neither has Herod, for he has sent him back to us. You see he has
   done nothing to call for his death.

   ^16So I will teach him a lesson and let him go."

   ^18But they all shouted out,

   "Kill him, and release Barabbas for us!"

   ^19(He was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that had taken
   place in the city and for murder.)

   ^20But Pilate wanted to let Jesus go, and he called out to them again.

   ^21But they kept on shouting,

   "Crucify him! Crucify him!"

   ^22And he said to them a third time,

   "Why, what has he done that is wrong? For I have found nothing about
   him to call for his death. So I will teach him a lesson and let him
   go."

   ^23But they persisted with loud outcries in demanding that he be
   crucified, and their shouting won.

   ^24And Pilate pronounced sentence that what they asked for should be
   done.

   ^25He released the man they asked for, who had been put in prison for
   riot and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will.

   ^26As they led Jesus away, they seized a man named Simon, from Cyrene,
   who was coming in from the country, and put the cross on his back, for
   him to carry behind Jesus.

   ^27He was followed by a great crowd of people and of women who were
   beating their breasts and lamenting him.

   ^28But Jesus turned to them and said,

   "Women of Jerusalem, do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for
   your children,

   ^29for a time is coming when they will say, Happy are the childless
   women, and those who have never borne or nursed children!'

   ^30Then people will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us!' and to
   the hills, Cover us up!'

   ^31For if this is what they do when the wood is green, what will happen
   when it is dry?"

   ^32Two criminals were also led out to execution with him.

   ^33When they reached the place called the Skull, they crucified him
   there, with the criminals one at his right and one at his left.

   ^34And they divided up his clothes among them by drawing lots for them,

   ^35while the people stood looking on. Even the leading councilors
   jeered at him, and said,

   "He has saved others, let him save himself, if he is really God's
   Christ, his Chosen One!"

   ^36The soldiers also made sport of him, coming up and offering him sour
   wine,

   ^37saying,

   "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!"

   ^38For there was a notice above his head, "This is the king of the
   Jews!"

   ^39One of the criminals who were hanging there, abused him, saying,

   "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us too!"

   ^40But the other reproved him and said,

   "Have you no fear even of God when you are suffering the same penalty?

   ^41And we are suffering it justly, for we are only getting our deserts,
   but this man has done nothing wrong."

   ^42And he said,

   "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!"

   ^43And he said to him,

   "I tell you, you will be in Paradise with me today!"

   ^44It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole country, and
   lasted until three in the afternoon,

   ^45as the sun was in eclipse. And the curtain before the sanctuary was
   torn in two.

   ^46Then Jesus gave a loud cry, and said,

   "Father, I intrust my spirit to your hands!"

   With these words he expired.

   ^47When the captain saw what had happened he praised God, and said,

   "This man was really innocent!"

   ^48And all the crowds that had collected for the sight, when they saw
   what happened, returned to the city beating their breasts.

   ^49And all his acquaintances and the women who had come with him from
   Galilee, stood at a distance looking on.

   ^50Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council, a good
   and upright man,

   ^51who had not voted for the plan or action of the council. He came
   from the Jewish town of Arimathea and lived in expectation of the
   Kingdom of God.

   ^52He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.

   ^53Then he took it down from the cross and wrapped it in linen and laid
   it in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had yet been laid.

   ^54It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was just beginning.

   ^55The women who had followed Jesus from Galilee followed and saw the
   tomb and how his body was put there.

   ^56Then they went home, and prepared spices and perfumes. On the
   Sabbath they rested in obedience to the commandment,
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 24

   ^1but on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the
   tomb, taking spices they had prepared.

   ^2But they found the stone rolled back from the tomb,

   ^3and when they went inside they could not find the body.

   ^4They were in great perplexity over this, when suddenly two men in
   dazzling clothing stood beside them.

   ^5The women were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but
   the men said to them,

   "Why do you look among the dead for him who is alive?

   ^6Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee,

   ^7when he said that the Son of Man must be handed over to wicked men
   and be crucified and rise again on the third day."

   ^8Then they remembered his words,

   ^9and they went back from the tomb and told all this to the eleven and
   all the rest.

   ^10They were Mary of Magdala and Joanna and Mary, James's mother; and
   the other women also told this to the apostles.

   ^11But the story seemed to them to be nonsense and they would not
   believe them.

   ^13That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus,
   about seven miles from Jerusalem,

   ^14and they were talking together about all these things that had
   happened.

   ^15And as they were talking and discussing them, Jesus himself came up
   and went with them,

   ^16but they were prevented from recognizing him.

   ^17And he said to them,

   "What is all this that you are discussing with each other on your way?"

   They stopped sadly,

   ^18and one of them named Cleopas said to him,

   "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know what has
   happened there lately?"

   ^19And he said,

   "What is it?"

   They said to him,

   "About Jesus of Nazareth, who in the eyes of God and of all the people
   was a prophet mighty in deed and word,

   ^20and how the high priests and our leading men gave him up to be
   sentenced to death, and had him crucified.

   ^21But we were hoping that he was to be the deliverer of Israel. Why,
   besides all this, it is three days since it happened.

   ^22But some women of our number have astounded us. They went to the
   tomb early this morning

   ^23and could not find his body, but came back and said that they had
   actually seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.

   ^24Then some of our party went to the tomb and found things just as the
   women had said, but they did not see him."

   ^25Then he said to them,

   "How foolish you are and how slow to believe all that the prophets have
   said!

   ^26Did not the Christ have to suffer thus before entering upon his
   glory?"

   ^27And he began with Moses and all the prophets and explained to them
   the passages all through the Scriptures that referred to himself.

   ^28When they reached the village to which they were going, he acted as
   though he were going on,

   ^29but they urged him not to, and said,

   "Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is nearly
   over."

   So he went in to stay with them.

   ^30And when he took his place with them at table, he took the bread and
   blessed it and broke it in pieces and handed it to them.

   ^31Then their eyes were opened and they knew him, and he vanished from
   them.

   ^32And they said to each other,

   "Did not our hearts glow when he was talking to us on the road, and was
   explaining the Scriptures to us?"

   ^33And they got up immediately and went back to Jerusalem, and found
   the eleven and their party all together,

   ^34and learned from them that the Master had really risen and had been
   seen by Simon.

   ^35And they told what had happened on the road, and how they had known
   him when he broke the bread in pieces.

   ^36While they were still talking of these things, he himself stood
   among them.

   ^37They were startled and panic-stricken, and thought they saw a ghost.

   ^38But he said to them,

   "Why are you so disturbed, and why do doubts arise in your minds?

   ^39Look at my hands and feet, for it is I myself! Feel of me and see,
   for a ghost has not flesh and bones, as you see I have."

   ^41But they could not yet believe it for sheer joy and they were
   amazed. And he said to them,

   "Have you anything here to eat?"

   ^42And they gave him a piece of broiled fish,

   ^43and he took it and ate it before their eyes.

   ^44Then he said to them,

   "This is what I told you when I was still with you--that everything
   that is written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the
   Psalms must come true."

   ^45Then he opened their minds to the understanding of the Scriptures,

   ^46and said to them,

   "The Scriptures said that Christ should suffer as he has done, and rise
   from the dead on the third day,

   ^47and that repentance leading to the forgiveness of sins should be
   preached to all the heathen in his name.

   ^48You are to be witnesses to all this, beginning at Jerusalem.

   ^49And I will send down upon you what my Father has promised. Wait here
   in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."

   ^50And he led them out as far as Bethany. Then he lifted up his hands
   and blessed them.

   ^51And as he was blessing them, he parted from them.

   ^52And they went back with great joy to Jerusalem,

   ^53and were constantly in the Temple, blessing God.

The Gospel According to John
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1In the beginning the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the
   Word was divine.

   ^2It was he that was with God in the beginning.

   ^3Everything came into existence through him, and apart from him
   nothing came to be.

   ^4It was by him that life came into existence, and that life was the
   light of mankind.

   ^5The light is still shining in the darkness, for the darkness has
   never put it out.

   ^6There appeared a man by the name of John, with a message from God.

   ^7He came to give testimony, to testify to the light, so that everyone
   might come to believe in it through him.

   ^8He was not the light; he came to testify to the light.

   ^9The real light, which sheds light upon everyone, was just coming into
   the world.

   ^10He came into the world, and though the world came into existence
   through him, the world did not recognize him.

   ^11He came to his home, and his own family did not welcome him.

   ^12But to all who did receive him and believe in him he gave the right
   to become children of God,

   ^13owing their birth not to nature nor to any human or physical
   impulse, but to God.

   ^14So the Word became flesh and blood and lived for a while among us,
   abounding in blessing and truth, and we saw the honor God had given
   him, such honor as an only son receives from his father.

   ^15(John testified to him and cried out--for it was he who said it--"He
   who was to come after me is now ahead of me, for he existed before
   me!")

   ^16For from his abundance we have all had a share, and received
   blessing after blessing.

   ^17For while the Law was given through Moses, blessing and truth came
   to us through Jesus Christ.

   ^18No one has ever seen God; it is the divine Only Son, who leans upon
   his Father's breast, that has made him known.

   ^19Now this is the testimony that John gave when the Jews sent priests
   and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.

   ^20He admitted--he made no attempt to deny it--he admitted that he was
   not the Christ.

   ^21Then they asked him,

   "What are you then? Are you Elijah?"

   He said,

   "No, I am not."

   "Are you the Prophet?"

   He answered,

   "No."

   ^22Then they said to him,

   "Who are you? We must have some answer to give those who sent us here.
   What have you to say for yourself?"

   ^23He said,

   "I am a voice of one shouting in the desert, Straighten the Lord's
   way!' as the prophet Isaiah said."

   ^24Now the messengers were Pharisees.

   ^25And they asked him,

   "Then why are you baptizing people, if you are not the Christ, nor
   Elijah, nor the Prophet?"

   ^26"I am only baptizing in water," John answered, "but someone is
   standing among you of whom you do not know.

   ^27He is to come after me, and I am not worthy to undo his shoe!"

   ^28This took place at Bethany, on the farther side of the Jordan, where
   John was baptizing.

   ^29The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and he said,

   "There is God's lamb, who is to remove the world's sin!

   ^30This is the man of whom I spoke when I said, After me there is
   coming a man who is even now ahead of me, for he existed before me.'

   ^31I did not know him, but it is in order that he may be made known to
   Israel that I have come and baptized people in water."

   ^32And John gave this testimony:

   "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove, and it remained
   upon him.

   ^33I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to
   me, The one on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain, is the one
   who is to baptize in the holy Spirit.'

   ^34And I did see it, and I testify that he is the Son of God."

   ^35Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,

   ^36and looking at Jesus as he passed, he said,

   "There is God's lamb!"

   ^37The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.

   ^38But Jesus turned, and seeing them following him he said,

   "What do you want?"

   They said to him,

   "Rabbi"--that is to say, Master--"Where are you staying?"

   ^39He said to them,

   "Come and you will see."

   So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent the rest of
   the day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.

   ^40Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what
   John said and followed Jesus.

   ^41Andrew immediately sought out his own brother Simon and said to him,

   "We have found the Messiah!"--that is to say, the Christ.

   ^42He took him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said,

   "You are Simon, son of John. You shall be called Cephas"--that is,
   Peter, which means rock.

   ^43The next day Jesus determined to leave for Galilee. And he sought
   out Philip and said to him,

   "Come with me."

   ^44Now Philip came from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.

   ^45Philip sought out Nathanael, and said to him,

   "We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the Law and about whom
   the prophets wrote; it is Jesus, the son of Joseph, who comes from
   Nazareth!"

   ^46Nathanael said to him,

   "Can anything good come from Nazareth?"

   Philip said to him,

   "Come and see!"

   ^47Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and he said of him,

   "Here is really an Israelite without any deceit in him!"

   ^48Nathanael said to him,

   "How do you know me?"

   Jesus answered,

   "While you were still under that fig tree, before Philip called you I
   saw you."

   ^49Nathanael answered,

   "Master, you are the Son of God! You are king of Israel!"

   ^50Jesus answered,

   "Do you believe in me because I told you that I had seen you under that
   fig tree? You will see greater things than that!"

   ^51And he said to him, "I tell you all, you will see heaven opened and
   God's angels going up, and coming down to the Son of Man!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus'
   mother was present.

   ^2Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.

   ^3The wine gave out, and Jesus' mother said to him,

   "They have no more wine!"

   ^4Jesus said to her,

   "Do not try to direct me. It is not yet time for me to act."

   ^5His mother said to the servants,

   "Do whatever he tells you."

   ^6Now there were six stone water jars there, for the ceremonial
   purification practiced by the Jews, each large enough to hold twenty or
   thirty gallons.

   ^7Jesus said to them,

   "Fill these jars with water."

   ^8So they filled them full. And he said to them,

   "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast."

   ^9And they did so. When the master of the feast tasted the water which
   had now turned into wine, without knowing where it had come
   from--though the servants who had drawn the water knew--

   ^10he called the bridegroom and said to him,

   "Everyone else serves his good wine first, and his poorer wine after
   people have drunk deeply, but you have kept back your good wine till
   now!"

   ^11This, the first of the signs of his mission, Jesus showed at Cana in
   Galilee. By it he showed his greatness, and his disciples believed in
   him.

   ^12After this Jesus went down to Capernaum with his mother, his
   brothers, and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.

   ^13Now the Jewish Passover was approaching, and Jesus went up to
   Jerusalem.

   ^14In the Temple he found the dealers in cattle, sheep, and pigeons,
   and the money-changers sitting at their tables.

   ^15And he made a lash out of rope, and drove them all, sheep and
   cattle, out of the Temple, and scattered the money-changers' coins on
   the ground, and overturned their tables.

   ^16And he said to the pigeon-dealers,

   "Take these things away! Do not turn my Father's house into a market!"

   ^17His disciples remembered that the Scriptures said, "My zeal for your
   house will consume me!"

   ^18Then the Jews addressed him and said,

   "What sign have you to show us, for acting in this way?"

   ^19Jesus answered,

   "Destroy this sanctuary, and I will raise it in three days!"

   ^20The Jews said,

   "It has taken forty-six years to build this sanctuary, and are you
   going to raise it in three days?"

   ^21But he was speaking of his body as the sanctuary.

   ^22So afterward when he had risen from the dead, his disciples
   remembered that he had said this, and they believed the passage of
   Scripture and what Jesus had said.

   ^23Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the Passover Festival, many, when
   they saw the signs that he showed, came to believe in him.

   ^24But Jesus on his part would not trust himself to them, for he knew
   them all,

   ^25and had no need of anybody's evidence about men, for he knew well
   what was in their hearts.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Among the Pharisees there was a man named Nicodemus, a leader among
   the Jews.

   ^2This man went to Jesus one night, and said to him,

   "Master, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no
   one can show the signs that you do, unless God is with him."

   ^3Jesus answered him,

   "I tell you, no one can see the Kingdom of God unless he is born over
   again from above!"

   ^4Nicodemus said to him,

   "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb
   over again and be born?"

   ^5Jesus answered,

   "I tell you, if a man does not owe his birth to water and spirit, he
   cannot get into the Kingdom of God.

   ^6Whatever owes its birth to the physical is physical, and whatever
   owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual.

   ^7Do not wonder at my telling you that you must be born over again from
   above.

   ^8The wind blows wherever it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but
   you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. That is the way
   with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit."

   ^9Nicodemus said to him,

   "How can that be?"

   ^10Jesus answered,

   "Are you the teacher of Israel and yet ignorant of this?

   ^11I tell you, we know what we are talking about and we have seen the
   things we testify to, yet you all reject our testimony.

   ^12If you will not believe the earthly things that I have told you, how
   can you believe the heavenly things I have to tell?

   ^13Yet no one has gone up into heaven except the Son of Man who came
   down from heaven.

   ^14And just as Moses in the desert lifted the serpent up in the air,
   the Son of Man must be lifted up,

   ^15so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."

   ^16For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that
   no one who believes in him should be lost, but that they should all
   have eternal life.

   ^17For God did not send his Son into the world to pass judgment upon
   the world, but that through him the world might be saved.

   ^18No one who believes in him has to come up for judgment. Anyone who
   does not believe stands condemned already, for not believing in God's
   only Son.

   ^19And the basis of the judgment is this, that the light has come into
   the world, and yet, because their actions were wicked, men have loved
   the darkness more than the light.

   ^20For everyone who does wrong hates the light and will not come to it,
   for fear his actions will be exposed.

   ^21But everyone who is living the truth will come to the light, to show
   that his actions have been performed in dependence upon God.

   ^22After this Jesus went into the country of Judea with his disciples,
   and stayed there with them and baptized.

   ^23John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, for there was plenty of
   water there, and people came there and were baptized.

   ^24For John had not yet been put in prison.

   ^25So a discussion arose between John's disciples and a man from Judea,
   about purification.

   ^26And they went to John and said to him,

   "Master, the man who was with you across the Jordan, and to whom you
   yourself gave testimony, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him."

   ^27John answered,

   "A man cannot get anything unless it is given to him from heaven.

   ^28You will bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ; I have
   been sent in advance of him.'

   ^29It is the bridegroom who has the bride; but the bridegroom's friend
   who stands outside and listens for his voice is very glad when he hears
   the bridegroom speak. So this happiness of mine is now complete.

   ^30He must grow greater and greater, but I less and less."

   ^31He who comes from above is above all others. A son of earth belongs
   to earth and speaks of earth. He who comes from heaven is above all
   others.

   ^32It is to what he has seen and heard that he gives testimony, and yet
   no one accepts his testimony.

   ^33Whoever does accept it has thereby acknowledged that God is true.

   ^34For he whom God has sent speaks God's words, for God gives him his
   Spirit without measure.

   ^35The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.

   ^36Whoever believes in the Son possesses eternal life, but whoever
   disobeys the Son will not experience life, but will remain under the
   anger of God.

  Chapter 4

   ^1So when the Lord learned that the Pharisees had been told that he was
   gaining and baptizing more disciples than John--

   ^2though it was not Jesus himself who baptized them, but his
   disciples--

   ^3he left Judea and went back again to Galilee.

   ^4Now he had to pass through Samaria.

   ^5So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the field that
   Jacob gave to his son Joseph,

   ^6and Jacob's spring was there. So Jesus, tired with his journey, sat
   down just as he was by the spring. It was about noon.

   ^7A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her,

   "Give me a drink."

   ^8For his disciples had gone into the town to buy some food.

   ^9So the Samaritan woman said to him,

   "How is it that a Jew like you asks a Samaritan woman like me for a
   drink?" For Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans.

   ^10Jesus answered,

   "If you knew what God has to give, and who it is that said to you, Give
   me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you
   living water."

   ^11She said to him,

   "You have nothing to draw water with, sir, and the well is deep. Where
   can you get your living water?

   ^12Are you a greater man than our forefather Jacob, who gave us this
   well, and drank from it himself, with his sons and his flocks?"

   ^13Jesus answered,

   "Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,

   ^14but anyone who drinks the water that I will give him will never be
   thirsty, but the water that I will give him will become a spring of
   water within him, bubbling up for eternal life."

   ^15The woman said to him,

   "Give me this water, sir, so that I may never be thirsty, nor have to
   come all this way to draw water."

   ^16He said to her,

   "Go and call your husband and come back here."

   ^17The woman answered,

   "I have no husband."

   Jesus said to her,

   ^18"You are right when you say you have no husband, for you have had
   five husbands and the man you are now living with is not your husband.
   What you say is true."

   ^19The woman said to him,

   "I see that you are a prophet, sir.

   ^20Our forefathers worshiped God on this mountain, and yet you Jews say
   that the place where people must worship God is at Jerusalem."

   ^21Jesus said to her,

   "Believe me, the time is coming when you will worship the Father
   neither on this mountain nor at Jerusalem.

   ^22You worship something you know nothing about; we know what we
   worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.

   ^23But a time is coming--it is already here!--when the true worshipers
   will worship the Father in spirit and sincerity, for the Father wants
   such worshipers.

   ^24God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship him in spirit and in
   sincerity."

   ^25The woman said to him,

   "I know that the Messiah is coming--he who is called the Christ. When
   he comes, he will tell us everything!"

   ^26Jesus said to her,

   "I who am talking to you am he!"

   ^27Just then his disciples came back, and they were surprised to find
   him talking with a woman, yet no one of them asked him what he wanted
   or why he was talking with her.

   ^28So the woman left her pitcher and went back to the town, and said to
   the people,

   ^29"Come, here is a man who has told me everything I ever did! Do you
   suppose he is the Christ?"

   ^30The people went out of the town to see him.

   ^31Meanwhile the disciples urged him, saying,

   "Master, eat something."

   ^32But he said to them,

   "I have food to eat of which you do not know."

   ^33So the disciples said to one another,

   "Do you suppose that someone has brought him something to eat?"

   ^34Jesus said to them,

   "My food is doing the will of him who has sent me, and finishing his
   work.

   ^35Are you not saying, Four months more and the harvest will come'?
   Look, I tell you! Raise your eyes and see the fields, for they are
   white for harvesting.

   ^36The reaper is already being paid and gathering the harvest for
   eternal life, so that the sower may be glad with the reaper.

   ^37For here the saying holds good, One sows, another reaps.'

   ^38I have sent you to reap a harvest on which you have not worked.
   Other men have worked and you have profited by their work."

   ^39Many of the Samaritans in that town came to believe in him because
   of the testimony the woman gave when she said, "He has told me
   everything I ever did!"

   ^40So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they asked him to stay with
   them, and he did stay there two days.

   ^41And a great many more believed because of what he said,

   ^42and they said to the woman,

   "It is no longer because of your statement that we believe, for we have
   heard him ourselves, and we know that he is really the Savior of the
   world."

   ^43When the two days were over, Jesus went on to Galilee,

   ^44for he himself declared that a prophet is not honored in his own
   country.

   ^45So when he reached Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had
   seen everything he had done at Jerusalem, at the festival, for they too
   had gone to the festival.

   ^46So he came back to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water into
   wine. There was at Capernaum one of the king's officials whose son was
   sick.

   ^47When he heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee, he
   went to him and begged him to come down and cure his son, for he was at
   the point of death.

   ^48Jesus said to him,

   "Unless you see signs and marvels you will never believe!"

   ^49The official said to him,

   "Come down, sir, before my child is dead!"

   ^50Jesus said to him,

   "You can go home. Your son is going to live."

   The man believed what Jesus said to him and went home.

   ^51While he was on the way, his slaves met him and told him that his
   boy was going to live.

   ^52So he asked them at what time he had begun to get better, and they
   said to him,

   "Yesterday at one o'clock the fever left him."

   ^53So the father knew that it was the very time when Jesus had said to
   him "Your son is going to live." And he and his whole household
   believed in Jesus.

   ^54This second sign Jesus showed after coming back from Judea to
   Galilee.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to
   Jerusalem.

   ^2Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheepgate a pool called in Hebrew
   Bethzatha, which has five colonnades.

   ^3In these there used to lie a great number of people who were sick,
   blind, lame, or paralyzed.

   ^5There was one man there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.

   ^6Jesus saw him lying there, and finding that he had been in this
   condition for a long time, said to him,

   "Do you want to get well?"

   ^7The sick man answered,

   "I have nobody, sir, to put me into the pool when the water stirs, but
   while I am getting down someone else steps in ahead of me."

   ^8Jesus said to him,

   "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk!"

   ^9And the man was immediately cured, and he picked up his mat and
   walked.

   ^10Now it was the Sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who had been
   cured,

   "It is the Sabbath, and it is against the Law for you to carry your
   mat."

   ^11But he answered,

   "The man who cured me said to me, Pick up your mat and walk.' "

   ^12They asked him,

   "Who was it that said to you, Pick it up and walk'?"

   ^13But the man who had been cured did not know who it was, for as there
   was a crowd there, Jesus had left the place.

   ^14Afterward Jesus found him in the Temple, and said to him,

   "See! You are well again. Give up sin, or something worse may happen to
   you."

   ^15The man went and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.

   ^16This was why the Jews used to persecute Jesus, because he did things
   like this on the Sabbath.

   ^17But he answered them,

   "My Father is still at work, and I work too."

   ^18On account of this the Jews were all the more eager to kill him,
   because he not only broke the Sabbath but actually called God his
   Father, thus putting himself on an equality with God.

   ^19So Jesus answered them,

   "I tell you, the Son cannot do anything of his own accord, unless he
   sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also
   does.

   ^20For the Father loves the Son and lets him see everything that he
   himself is doing, and he will let him see greater deeds than these, to
   make you wonder.

   ^21For just as the Father awakens the dead and makes them come to life,
   the Son makes anyone whom he chooses come to life.

   ^22For the Father passes judgment on no one, but he has committed the
   judgment entirely to the Son,

   ^23so that all men may honor the Son just as much as they honor the
   Father. Whoever refuses to honor the Son refuses to honor the Father
   who sent him.

   ^24I tell you, whoever listens to my message and believes him who has
   sent me, possesses eternal life, and will not come to judgment, but has
   already passed out of death into life.

   ^25I tell you, the time is coming--it is here already!--when those who
   are dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and those who
   listen to it will live.

   ^26For just as the Father is self-existent, he has given self-existence
   to the Son,

   ^27and he has given him the authority to act as judge, because he is a
   son of man.

   ^28Do not be surprised at this, for the time is coming when all who are
   in their graves will listen to his voice,

   ^29and those who have done right will come out to resurrection and
   life, and those who have done wrong, to resurrection and judgment.

   ^30I cannot do anything of my own accord. I pass judgment just as I am
   told to do, and my judgment is just, for I am not seeking to do what I
   please, but what pleases him who has sent me.

   ^31"If I testify to myself, my testimony is not true.

   ^32It is someone else who testifies to me, and I know that the
   testimony that he gives about me is true.

   ^33You yourselves sent to John, and he testified to the truth.

   ^34But the testimony that I accept is not from any man; I am only
   saying this that you may be saved.

   ^35He was the lamp that burned and shone, and you were ready to be
   gladdened for a while by his light.

   ^36But I have higher testimony than John's, for the things that my
   Father has intrusted to me to accomplish, the very things that I am
   doing, are proof that my Father has sent me,

   ^37and my Father who has sent me has thus borne witness to me. You have
   never heard his voice or seen his form,

   ^38and you do not keep his message in your hearts, for you do not
   believe the messenger whom he has sent.

   ^39You pore over the Scriptures, for you think that you will find
   eternal life in them, and these very Scriptures testify to me,

   ^40yet you refuse to come to me for life.

   ^41I do not accept any honor from men,

   ^42but I know well that you have not the love of God in your hearts.

   ^43I have come in my Father's name, and you refuse to accept me. If
   someone else comes in his own name you will accept him.

   ^44Yet how can you believe in me, when you accept honor from one
   another, instead of seeking the honor that comes from the one God?

   ^45Do not suppose that I will accuse you to the Father. Moses is your
   accuser--Moses, on whom you have fixed your hopes!

   ^46For if you really believed Moses, you would believe me, for it was
   about me that he wrote.

   ^47But if you refuse to believe what he wrote, how are you ever to
   believe what I say?"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, or
   Tiberias, and a great crowd followed him,

   ^2because they could see the signs he showed in what he did for the
   sick.

   ^3But Jesus went up on the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.

   ^4Now the Jewish festival of the Passover was coming.

   ^5So Jesus, raising his eyes and seeing that a great crowd was coming
   up to him, said to Philip,

   "Where can we buy food for these people to eat?"

   ^6Now he said this to test him, for he knew what he meant to do.

   ^7Philip answered,

   "Forty dollars' worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to
   have even a little."

   ^8Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, another of his disciples, said to him,

   ^9"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and a couple of fish,
   but what is that among so many people?"

   ^10Jesus said,

   "Make the people sit down."

   There was plenty of grass there, so the men threw themselves down,
   about five thousand of them.

   ^11Then Jesus took the loaves, and gave thanks, and distributed them
   among the people who were resting on the ground, and in the same way as
   much of the fish as they wanted.

   ^12When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples,

   "Pick up the pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted."

   ^13So they picked them up, and they filled twelve baskets with pieces
   of the five barley loaves that were left after the people had eaten.

   ^14When the people saw the signs that he showed, they said,

   "This is really the Prophet who was to come into the world!"

   ^15So Jesus, seeing that they meant to come and carry him off to make
   him king, retired again to the hill by himself.

   ^16But in the evening his disciples went down to the sea

   ^17and got into a boat and started across the sea for Capernaum. By
   this time it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them;

   ^18a strong wind was blowing and the sea was growing rough.

   ^19When they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on
   the sea and approaching the boat, and they were terrified.

   ^20But he said to them,

   "It is I; do not be afraid!"

   ^21Then as soon as they consented to take him into the boat, the boat
   was at the shore they had been trying to reach.

   ^22Next day the people who had stayed on the other side of the sea saw
   that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not
   embarked in it with his disciples, but that the disciples had gone away
   by themselves.

   ^23But some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where they had
   eaten the bread after Jesus had given thanks for it.

   ^24So when the people saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were any
   longer there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search
   of him.

   ^25And when they had crossed the sea and found him, they said to him,

   "When did you get here, Master?"

   ^26Jesus answered,

   "I tell you, it is not because of the signs you have seen that you have
   come in search of me, but because you ate that bread and had all you
   wanted of it.

   ^27You must not work for the food that perishes, but for that which
   lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, for God the
   Father has authorized him to do so."

   ^28Then they said to him,

   "What must we do to carry out God's work?"

   ^29Jesus answered them,

   "The work God has for you is to believe in the messenger that he has
   sent to you."

   ^30Then they said to him,

   "Then what sign do you show for us to see and so come to believe you?
   What work are you doing?

   ^31Our forefathers in the desert had manna to eat; as the Scripture
   says, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat!' "

   ^32Jesus said to them,

   "I tell you, Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my
   Father gives you the bread out of heaven,

   ^33for it is God's bread that comes down out of heaven and gives life
   to the world."

   ^34Then they said to him,

   "Give us that bread always, sir!"

   ^35Jesus said to them,

   "I am the bread that gives life. No one who comes to me will ever be
   hungry, and no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty.

   ^36But as I have told you, although you have seen me, you will not
   believe.

   ^37All that my Father gives to me will come to me, and I will never
   refuse anyone who comes to me,

   ^38for I have come down from heaven not to do what I please but what
   pleases him who has sent me.

   ^39And the purpose of him who has sent me is this, that I should lose
   nothing of all that he has given me, but should raise them to life on
   the Last Day.

   ^40For it is the purpose of my Father that everyone who sees the Son
   and believes in him shall have eternal life, and that I shall raise him
   to life on the Last Day."

   ^41The Jews complained of him for saying, "I am the bread that has come
   out of heaven,"

   ^42and they said,

   "Is he not Joseph's son, Jesus, whose father and mother we know? How
   can he now say, I have come down out of heaven'?"

   ^43Jesus answered,

   "Do not complain to one another.

   ^44No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him to me;
   then I myself will raise him to life on the Last Day.

   ^45In the prophets it is written, And all men will be taught by God!'
   Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him will come to me.

   ^46Not that anyone has ever seen the Father, except him who is from
   God; he has seen the Father.

   ^47I tell you, whoever believes already possesses eternal life.

   ^48I am the bread that gives life.

   ^49Your forefathers in the desert ate the manna and yet they died.

   ^50But here is bread that comes down out of heaven, and no one who eats
   it will ever die.

   ^51I am this living bread that has come down out of heaven. Whoever
   eats this bread will live forever, and the bread that I will give for
   the world's life is my own flesh!"

   ^52This led the Jews to dispute with one another. They said,

   "How can he give us his flesh to eat?"

   ^53Then Jesus said to them,

   "I tell you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink
   his blood, you have no self-existent life.

   ^54Whoever lives on my flesh and drinks my blood possesses eternal
   life, and I will raise him to life on the Last Day.

   ^55For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.

   ^56Whoever lives on my flesh and drinks my blood remains united to me
   and I remain united to him.

   ^57Just as the living Father has sent me, and I live because of the
   Father, so he who lives on me will live because of me.

   ^58This is the bread that has come down out of heaven--not like that
   which your forefathers ate and yet died. Whoever lives on this bread
   will live forever."

   ^59Jesus said all this while he was teaching in the synagogue at
   Capernaum.

   ^60Many of his disciples on hearing it said,

   "This is a harsh teaching! Who can listen to it?"

   ^61But Jesus, knowing that his disciples were complaining about this,
   said to them,

   "Does this stagger you?

   ^62Then what if you see the Son of Man go up where he was before?

   ^63The Spirit is what gives life; flesh is of no use at all. The things
   that I have said to you are spirit and they are life.

   ^64Yet there are some of you who will not believe." For Jesus knew from
   the first who would not believe, and who was going to betray him.

   ^65And he added,

   "This is why I said to you, No one can come to me unless he is enabled
   to do so by the Father.' "

   ^66In consequence of this many of his disciples drew back and would not
   go about with him any longer.

   ^67So Jesus said to the Twelve,

   "Do you mean to go away too?"

   ^68Simon Peter answered,

   "To whom can we go, sir? You have a message of eternal life,

   ^69and we believe and are satisfied that you are the Holy One of God."

   ^70Jesus answered them,

   "Did I not myself select all twelve of you? And even of you, one is an
   informer."

   ^71He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, though he was one
   of the Twelve, was going to betray him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1After this Jesus went from place to place in Galilee, for he would
   not do so in Judea, because the Jews were making efforts to kill him.

   ^2But the Jewish camping festival was coming.

   ^3So his brothers said to him,

   "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, to let your disciples also
   see the things you are doing.

   ^4For no one acts in secret when he desires to be publicly known. If
   you are going to do these things, let the world see you."

   ^5For even his brothers did not believe in him.

   ^6Then Jesus said to them,

   "It is not yet time for me to act, but any time is suitable for you.

   ^7It is impossible for the world to hate you, but it does hate me for
   testifying that its ways are wrong.

   ^8As for you, go up to the festival; I am not going up to this festival
   as yet, for it is not quite time for me to go."

   ^9That was what he told them, and he stayed on in Galilee.

   ^10But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, then Jesus went
   up also, not publicly, but as though he did not wish to be observed.

   ^11Now the Jews were looking for him at the festival and asking where
   he was,

   ^12and there was a great deal of muttering about him among the crowds,
   some saying that he was a good man, and others that he was not, but was
   imposing on the people.

   ^13But no one spoke of him in public, for fear of the Jews.

   ^14But when the festival was half over, Jesus went up to the Temple and
   began to teach.

   ^15This astonished the Jews.

   "How is it that this man can read?" they said, "when he has never gone
   to school?"

   ^16So Jesus answered,

   "My teaching is not my own; it comes from him who has sent me.

   ^17Anyone who resolves to do his will will know whether my teaching
   comes from God, or originates with me.

   ^18Whoever speaks simply for himself is looking for honor for himself,
   but whoever looks for honor for the person who has sent him shows his
   sincerity; there is no dishonesty about him.

   ^19Was it not Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys the
   Law. Why are you trying to kill me?"

   ^20The crowd answered,

   "You must be possessed! Who is trying to kill you?"

   ^21Jesus answered,

   "I have done just one deed, and you are all astonished at it.

   ^22Yet Moses gave you the rite of circumcision--not that it began with
   Moses but with your forefathers--and you practice it even on the
   Sabbath.

   ^23But if a person undergoes circumcision on a Sabbath, to avoid
   breaking the Law of Moses, are you angry at me for making a man
   perfectly well on a Sabbath?

   ^24You must not judge so externally; you must judge justly!"

   ^25Some of the people of Jerusalem said, "Is not this the man they want
   to kill?

   ^26And here he is speaking publicly, and they say nothing to him! Can
   the authorities really have found that he is the Christ?

   ^27But then, we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ
   comes, no one will know where he is from."

   ^28So Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple, cried out,

   "You do know me and you do know where I come from, and I have not come
   of my own accord but someone who is very real, whom you do not know,
   has sent me.

   ^29I do know him, because I come from him, and he has sent me here."

   ^30Then they tried to arrest him, and yet no one laid hands on him,
   because he was not yet ready.

   ^31But many of the people believed in him, and said,

   "Will the Christ show more signs when he comes than this man has
   shown?"

   ^32The Pharisees heard the people saying these things about him in
   whispers, and the high priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to
   arrest him.

   ^33Jesus said,

   "I am to be with you a little while longer, and then I am going to him
   who has sent me.

   ^34You will look for me and you will not find me, and you will not be
   able to go where I shall be."

   ^35Then the Jews said to one another,

   "Where is he going, that we shall not find him? Is he going to our
   people scattered among the Greeks, and will he teach the Greeks?

   ^36What does he mean by saying You will look for me and you will not
   find me, and you will not be able to go where I shall be'?"

   ^37Now on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood up
   and cried out,

   "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.

   ^38If anyone believes in me, streams of living water, as the Scripture
   says, shall flow forth from his heart."

   ^39He meant by this the Spirit which those who believed in him were to
   receive--for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet
   been glorified.

   ^40So some of the people, when they heard these words, said,

   "This is certainly the Prophet!"

   ^41Others said,

   "This is the Christ!"

   But they rejoined,

   "What! Is the Christ to come from Galilee?

   ^42Do not the Scriptures say that the Christ is to spring from the
   descendants of David and to come from the village of Bethlehem where
   David lived?"

   ^43So the people were divided about him,

   ^44and some of them wanted to arrest him, yet no one laid hands on him.

   ^45The attendants went back to the high priests and Pharisees, and they
   said to the attendants,

   "Why have you not brought him?"

   ^46The attendants answered,

   "No man ever talked as he does!"

   ^47The Pharisees answered,

   "Have you been imposed upon too?

   ^48Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him?

   ^49But these common people who do not know the Law are doomed!"

   ^50One of them, Nicodemus, who had previously gone to Jesus, said to
   them,

   ^51"Does our Law condemn the accused without first hearing what he has
   to say, and finding out what he has done?"

   ^52They answered,

   "Are you from Galilee too? Study and you will find that no prophet is
   to appear from Galilee."

  Chapter 8

   ^12Then Jesus spoke to them again and said,

   "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not have to walk
   in darkness but will have the light of life."

   ^13The Pharisees said to him,

   "You are testifying to yourself. Your testimony is not true."

   ^14Jesus answered,

   "Even if I am testifying to myself, my testimony is true, for I know
   where I have come from and where I am going; but you do not know where
   I come from or where I am going.

   ^15You judge by material standards, but I am judging nobody.

   ^16But even if I do judge, my decision is just, because I am not by
   myself, but the Father who sent me is with me.

   ^17Why, in your own Law it is stated that the testimony of two persons
   is valid.

   ^18Here I am testifying to myself, and the Father who has sent me
   testifies to me."

   ^19Then they said to him,

   "Where is your Father?"

   Jesus answered,

   "You do not know either me or my Father. If you knew me, you would know
   my Father too."

   ^20He said these things in the treasury, as he was teaching in the
   Temple, and no one arrested him, because he was not yet ready.

   ^21Then he said to them again,

   "I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in the
   midst of your sin. You cannot come where I am going."

   ^22So the Jews said,

   "Is he going to kill himself, and is that why he says, You cannot come
   where I am going'?"

   ^23He said to them,

   "You are from below; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do
   not belong to this world.

   ^24That is why I said to you that you would die in the midst of your
   sins, for unless you believe that I am what I say, you will die in the
   midst of your sins."

   ^25They said to him,

   "Who are you?"

   Jesus said to them,

   ^26"Why do I even talk to you at all? I have a great deal to say about
   you and to condemn in you, yet he who sent me is truthful, and the
   things that I say to the world are things that I have learned from
   him."

   ^27They did not understand that he was speaking to them of the Father.

   ^28So Jesus said,

   "When you lift the Son of Man up in the air, then you will know that I
   am what I say, and that I do nothing of my own accord, but speak as the
   Father has instructed me.

   ^29And he who has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I
   always do what pleases him."

   ^30As he said this, many believed in him.

   ^31So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him,

   "If you abide by what I teach, you are really disciples of mine,

   ^32and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."

   ^33They answered,

   "We are descended from Abraham, and have never been anyone's slaves.
   How can you say to us, You will be set free'?"

   ^34Jesus answered,

   "I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.

   ^35Now a slave does not belong to a household permanently; but a son
   does.

   ^36So if the Son sets you free you will be really free.

   ^37I know that you are descended from Abraham, yet you want to kill me,
   because there is no room in your hearts for my teaching.

   ^38It is what I have seen in the presence of my Father that I tell, and
   it is what you have heard from your father that you do."

   ^39They answered,

   "Our father is Abraham."

   Jesus said to them,

   "If you are Abraham's children, then do what Abraham did.

   ^40But instead you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the
   truth he has heard from God. Abraham would not have done that.

   ^41You are doing as your father does."

   They said to him,

   "We are not illegitimate children. We have one father, God himself."

   ^42Jesus said to them,

   "If God were your father, you would love me, for I have come from God.
   I have not come of my own accord, but he has sent me.

   ^43Why is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you
   cannot bear to listen to my message.

   ^44The devil is the father you are sprung from, and you want to carry
   out your father's wishes. He was a murderer from the first, and he has
   nothing to do with the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he
   tells a lie, he speaks in his true character, for he is a liar and the
   father of them.

   ^45But because I tell the truth you will not believe me.

   ^46Who among you can prove me guilty of sin? But if I tell you the
   truth, why do you refuse to believe me?

   ^47Whoever is sprung from God listens to God's words. The reason you
   refuse to listen is that you are not sprung from God."

   ^48The Jews answered,

   "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and are
   possessed?"

   ^49Jesus answered,

   "I am not possessed, but I have respect for my Father, and you have no
   respect for me.

   ^50But I do not seek honor for myself; there is someone who seeks it
   for me, and is the judge of it.

   ^51I tell you, if anyone observes my teaching, he will never experience
   death."

   ^52The Jews said to him,

   "Now we are sure that you are possessed! Abraham is dead and so are the
   prophets, and yet you say, If anyone observes my teaching, he will
   never know what death is!'

   ^53Are you a greater man than our forefather Abraham? Yet he is dead
   and the prophets are dead. What do you claim to be?"

   ^54Jesus answered,

   "If I show special honor to myself, such honor counts for nothing. It
   is my Father who shows me honor. You say he is your God,

   ^55yet you have never come to know him. But I know him. If I say I do
   not know him, I will be a liar like yourselves. No! I do know him, and
   I am faithful to his message.

   ^56Your forefather Abraham exulted at the thought of seeing my coming.
   He has seen it, and it has made him glad."

   ^57The Jews said to him,

   "You are not fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"

   ^58Jesus said to them,

   "I tell you, I existed before Abraham was born!"

   ^59At that, the Jews picked up stones to throw at him, but he
   disappeared and made his way out of the Temple.

  Chapter 9

   ^1As he passed along, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.

   ^2His disciples asked him,

   "Master, for whose sin was this man born blind? For his own, or for
   that of his parents?"

   ^3Jesus answered,

   "It was neither for his own sin nor for that of his parents, but to let
   what God can do be illustrated in his case.

   ^4We must carry on the work of him who has sent me while the daylight
   lasts. Night is coming, when no one can do any work.

   ^5As long as I am in the world, I am a light for the world."

   ^6As he said this he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva,
   and he put the clay on the man's eyes,

   ^7and said to him,

   "Go and wash them in the Pool of Siloam"--a name which means One who
   has been sent. So he went and washed them, and went home able to see.

   ^8Then his neighbors and people who had formerly seen him begging,
   said,

   "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"

   ^9Some said,

   "Yes! It is he!"

   Others said,

   "No! but he looks like him."

   He himself said,

   "I am the man."

   ^10So they said to him,

   "Then how does it happen that you can see?"

   ^11He answered,

   "The man they call Jesus made some clay and rubbed it on my eyes, and
   said to me, Go to Siloam and wash them.' So I went and when I had
   washed them I could see."

   ^12They said to him,

   "Where is he?"

   He answered,

   "I do not know."

   ^13They took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.

   ^14Now it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made the clay and made him
   able to see.

   ^15So once more the Pharisees asked him how he had become able to see,
   and he said to them,

   "He put some clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and I can see."

   ^16Then some of the Pharisees said,

   "This man does not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath."

   But others said,

   "How can a sinful man show such signs as this?"

   And there was a division of opinion among them.

   ^17So they asked the blind man again,

   "What have you to say about him, because he has made you able to see?"

   He said,

   "He is a prophet!"

   ^18But the Jews would not believe that he had been blind and had become
   able to see until they summoned the parents of the man who had been
   given his sight,

   ^19and asked them,

   "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it that he can
   see now?"

   ^20His parents answered,

   "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.

   ^21But we do not know how it is that he can see now, or who has made
   him able to see. You must ask him. He is grown up. Let him tell you
   about himself."

   ^22His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the
   Jews had already made an agreement that if anyone acknowledged Jesus as
   the Christ, he should be excluded from the synagogues.

   ^23That was why his parents said, "He is grown up; you must ask him."

   ^24So they again summoned the man who had been blind, and they said to
   him,

   "Give God the praise. This man we know is a sinful man."

   ^25He answered,

   "I do not know about his being a sinful man. All I know is that I was
   blind before and now I can see."

   ^26They said to him,

   "What did he do to you? How did he make you able to see?"

   ^27He answered,

   "I have already told you and you would not listen. Why do you want to
   hear it again? Do you want to become disciples of his too?"

   ^28Then they sneered at him, and said,

   "You are a disciple of his yourself, but we are disciples of Moses.

   ^29We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man
   came from."

   ^30The man answered,

   "There is something very strange about this! You do not know where he
   came from, and yet he has made me able to see!

   ^31We know that God does not listen to sinful people, but if a man is
   devout and obeys God, God will listen to him.

   ^32It was never heard of in this world that anyone made a man born
   blind able to see.

   ^33If this man were not from God, he could not do anything."

   ^34They answered,

   "You were born in utter sin, and are you trying to teach us?"

   So they excluded him from the synagogue.

   ^35Jesus learned that they had excluded him, and he found the man and
   said to him,

   "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"

   ^36The man answered,

   "Who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him."

   ^37Jesus said to him,

   "You have seen him already, and it is he who is now talking to you."

   ^38And he said,

   "I believe, sir!" and he fell on his knees before him.

   ^39And Jesus said,

   "I have come into this world to judge men, that those who cannot see
   may see, and that those who can see may become blind."

   ^40Some Pharisees who were present heard this, and they said to him,

   "Then are we blind too?"

   ^41Jesus said to them,

   "If you were blind, you would be guilty of no sin, but as it is, you
   say We can see'; so your sin continues.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1"I tell you, any man who does not enter the sheepfold by the door,
   but climbs over at some other place, is a thief and robber.

   ^2But the man who enters by the door is the shepherd of the flock.

   ^3The watchman opens the door to him, and the sheep obey his voice, and
   he calls to his own sheep and leads them out.

   ^4When he gets his own flock all out, he goes in front of them, and the
   sheep follow him, because they know his voice.

   ^5But they will never follow a stranger but will run away from him,
   because they do not know the voices of strangers."

   ^6This was the figure Jesus used in speaking to them, but they did not
   understand what he meant by it.

   ^7So Jesus said again,

   "I tell you, I am the door of the sheepfold.

   ^8All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep
   would not obey them.

   ^9I am the door. Whoever enters through me will be saved, and will pass
   in and out and find pasture.

   ^10A thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come to let
   them have life, and to let them have it in abundance.

   ^11I am the good shepherd. A good shepherd will give his life for his
   sheep.

   ^12A hired man who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep, when
   he sees a wolf coming, will leave the sheep and run away, and the wolf
   will carry them off and scatter the flock.

   ^13For he is only a hired man, and does not care about the sheep.

   ^14I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me,

   ^15just as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I am giving
   my life for my sheep.

   ^16I have other sheep too that do not belong to this fold. I must lead
   them too, and they will obey my voice, and they will all become one
   flock, with one shepherd.

   ^17This is why the Father loves me, because I am giving my life, but
   giving it to take it back again.

   ^18No one has taken it from me, but I am giving it of my own accord. I
   have power to give it, and I have power to take it back again. These
   are the orders I have received from my Father."

   ^19These words caused a fresh division of opinion among the Jews.

   ^20Many of them said,

   "He is possessed and mad! Why do you listen to him?"

   ^21Others said,

   "These are not the words of a man who is possessed. Can a madman make
   blind men see?"

   ^22That was the time of the Rededication Festival at Jerusalem. It was
   winter time

   ^23and Jesus was walking up and down inside the Temple, in Solomon's
   Colonnade.

   ^24So the Jews gathered around him and said to him,

   "How much longer are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are
   really the Christ, tell us so frankly!"

   ^25Jesus answered,

   "I have told you so, and you will not believe it. The things I have
   been doing by my Father's authority are my credentials,

   ^26but you do not believe it because you do not belong to my sheep.

   ^27My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them and they follow me,

   ^28and I give them eternal life, and they shall never be lost, and no
   one shall tear them out of my hands.

   ^29What my Father has intrusted to me is of more importance than
   everything else, and no one can tear anything out of the Father's
   hands.

   ^30The Father and I are one."

   ^31The Jews again picked up stones to stone him with.

   ^32Jesus answered,

   "I have let you see many good things from the Father; which of them do
   you mean to stone me for?"

   ^33The Jews answered,

   "We are not stoning you for doing anything good, but for your impious
   talk, and because you, a mere man, make yourself out to be God."

   ^34Jesus answered,

   "Is it not declared in your Law, I said, "You are gods*#")?

   ^35If those to whom God's message was addressed were called gods--and
   the Scripture cannot be set aside--

   ^36do you mean to say to me whom the Father has consecrated and made
   his messenger to the world, You are blasphemous,' because I said, I am
   God's Son'?

   ^37If I am not doing the things my Father does, do not believe me.

   ^38But if I am doing them, then even if you will not believe me,
   believe the things I do, in order that you may realize and learn that
   the Father is in union with me, and I am in union with the Father."

   ^39In consequence of this they again tried to arrest him, and he
   withdrew out of their reach.

   ^40He went across the Jordan again to the place where John used to
   baptize at first, and there he stayed.

   ^41And people came to him in great numbers, and they said of him,

   "John did not show any sign in proof of his mission, but all that he
   said about this man was true."

   ^42And many became believers in him in that place.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1Now a man named Lazarus was sick; he lived in Bethany, the village of
   Mary and her sister Martha.

   ^2It was the Mary who poured perfume upon the Master and wiped his feet
   with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

   ^3So the sisters sent this message to Jesus: "Master, your friend is
   sick."

   ^4When Jesus received it he said,

   "This sickness is not to end in death, but is for the honor of God,
   that through it the Son of God may be honored."

   ^5Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

   ^6So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed on for two days in
   the place where he was,

   ^7and then afterward said to his disciples,

   "Let us go back to Judea."

   ^8The disciples said to him,

   "Master, the Jews have just been trying to stone you, and are you going
   back there again?"

   ^9Jesus answered,

   "Is not the day twelve hours long? If a man travels by day he will not
   stumble, for he can see the light of this world;

   ^10but if he travels at night he will stumble because he has no light."

   ^11He told them this, and then he added,

   "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake
   him."

   ^12The disciples said to him,

   "Master, if he has fallen asleep he will recover."

   ^13Now Jesus had referred to his death. But they supposed that he meant
   a natural falling asleep.

   ^14So Jesus then told them plainly,

   ^15"Lazarus is dead, and for your sake I am glad that I was not there,
   so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him."

   ^16So Thomas the Twin said to his fellow-disciples,

   "Let us go also, and die with him."

   ^17When Jesus arrived he found that Lazarus had been buried for four
   days.

   ^18Now Bethany is only about two miles from Jerusalem,

   ^19and a number of Jews had come out to see Mary and Martha, to condole
   with them about their brother.

   ^20When Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went out to meet him,
   but Mary remained at home.

   ^21Martha said to Jesus,

   "Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died!

   ^22Even now I know that anything you ask God for, he will give you."

   ^23Jesus said to her,

   "Your brother will rise."

   ^24Martha said to him,

   "I know that he will rise at the resurrection, on the Last Day."

   ^25Jesus said to her,

   "I myself am Resurrection and Life. He who believes in me will live on,
   even if he dies,

   ^26and no one who is alive and believes in me will ever die. Do you
   believe that?"

   ^27She said to him,

   "Yes, Master, I do indeed believe that you are the Christ, the Son of
   God, who was to come into the world."

   ^28With these words she went and called her sister Mary, whispering to
   her,

   "Here is the Master, asking for you."

   ^29When she heard it she sprang up and went to him,

   ^30for Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still at the
   place where Martha had met him.

   ^31The Jews who were sitting with her in the house, condoling with her,
   when they saw Mary spring up and go out, supposed that she was going to
   weep at the tomb, and followed her.

   ^32When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet,
   and said,

   "Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died!"

   ^33When Jesus saw her weep and the Jews who had come with her weeping
   too, repressing a groan, and yet showing great agitation,

   ^34he said,

   "Where have you laid him?"

   They answered,

   "Come and see, Master."

   ^35Jesus shed tears.

   ^36So the Jews said,

   "See how much he loved him!"

   ^37But some of them said,

   "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of that blind man, have kept
   Lazarus from dying?"

   ^38Again repressing a groan, Jesus went to the tomb. It was a cave with
   a stone laid against the mouth of it.

   ^39Jesus said,

   "Move the stone away."

   The dead man's sister, Martha, said to him,

   "Master, by this time he is decaying, for he has been dead four days."

   ^40Jesus said to her,

   "Have I not promised you that if you will believe in me you will see
   the glory of God?"

   ^41So they moved the stone away. And Jesus looked upward and said,

   "Father, I thank you for listening to me,

   ^42though I knew that you always listen to me. But I have said this for
   the sake of the people that are standing around me that they may
   believe that you have made me your messenger."

   ^43After saying this he called out in a loud voice,

   "Lazarus, come out!"

   ^44The dead man came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and with
   his face muffled with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them,

   "Unbind him and let him move."

   ^45So it came about that many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary
   and saw what Jesus did, came to believe in him,

   ^46but some of them went back to the Pharisees and told them what he
   had done.

   ^47Then the high priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the
   council, and they said,

   "What are we to do about the fact that this man is showing so many
   signs?

   ^48If we let him go on, everybody will believe in him, and then the
   Romans will come and put an end to our holy place and our people."

   ^49But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to
   them,

   ^50"You know nothing about it. You do not realize that it is to your
   interest that one man should die for the people, instead of the whole
   nation being destroyed."

   ^51Now he was not self-moved in saying this, but as high priest for
   that year he was inspired to say that Jesus was to die for the nation--

   ^52and not only for the nation but also for the purpose of uniting the
   scattered children of God.

   ^53So from that day they planned to kill Jesus.

   ^54In consequence of this, Jesus did not appear in public among the
   Jews any longer, but he left that neighborhood and went to the district
   near the desert, to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his
   disciples.

   ^55Now the Jewish Passover Festival was approaching and many people
   went up to Jerusalem from the country, to purify themselves before the
   Passover.

   ^56So they were looking for Jesus there, and asking one another as they
   stood in the Temple,

   "What do you think? Do you think he will not come to the festival at
   all?"

   ^57For the high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone
   who found out where he was should let them know, so that they might
   arrest him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus,
   whom he had raised from the dead, was living.

   ^2They gave a dinner for him there, and Martha waited on them, while
   Lazarus was at the table with him.

   ^3And Mary took a pound of choice perfume, very costly, and poured it
   on Jesus' feet, and then wiped his feet with her hair, and the whole
   house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

   ^4But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was going to betray
   him, said,

   ^5"Why was this perfume not sold for sixty dollars, and the money given
   to the poor?"

   ^6But he did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because
   he was a thief and when he had charge of the purse he used to take what
   was put in it.

   ^7Jesus said,

   "Let her alone; let her keep it for the day of my funeral,

   ^8for you always have the poor among you, but you will not always have
   me."

   ^9A great many of the Jews found out that he was there, and they came
   to Bethany not only to see Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had
   raised from the dead.

   ^10But the high priests planned to kill Lazarus also,

   ^11for because of him many of the Jews were leaving them and becoming
   believers in Jesus.

   ^12On the following day the crowds that had come up to the festival,
   hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

   ^13got palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting,

   "God bless him!

   God bless him who comes in the Lord's name!

   Blessings on the king of Israel!"

   ^14And Jesus found a young ass and mounted it, in accordance with the
   Scripture,

   ^15"Do not be afraid, Daughter of Zion!

   See, your king is coming mounted on an ass's colt!"

   ^16His disciples did not understand this at the time but after Jesus
   was glorified they remembered that this was said of him in Scripture
   and that it had happened to him.

   ^17The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the
   tomb and raised him from the dead was telling about it.

   ^18That was why the crowd went out to meet him, because they heard that
   he had showed that sign.

   ^19So the Pharisees said to one another,

   "You see, you cannot do anything! The whole world has run after him!"

   ^20There were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the
   festival,

   ^21and they went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and made
   this request of him:

   "Sir, we want to see Jesus."

   ^22Philip went and told Andrew, and Andrew and Philip went to Jesus and
   told him.

   ^23Jesus answered,

   "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

   ^24I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls on the ground and dies, it
   remains just one grain. But if it dies, it yields a great harvest.

   ^25Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this
   world will preserve it for eternal life.

   ^26If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and wherever I am found, my
   servant must be also. If anyone serves me, my Father will show him
   honor.

   ^27Now my heart is troubled; what am I to say? Father, save me from
   this trial! And yet it was for this very purpose that I have come to
   this trial.

   ^28Father, honor your own name!"

   Then there came a voice from the sky,

   "I have honored it, and I will honor it again!"

   ^29The crowd of bystanders heard it and said it was thunder. Others
   said,

   "It was an angel speaking to him!"

   ^30Jesus answered,

   "It was not for my sake that the voice came, but for yours.

   ^31The judgment of this world is now in progress. Its evil genius is
   now to be expelled,

   ^32and if I am lifted up from the ground, I will draw all men to
   myself."

   ^33He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.

   ^34The crowd answered,

   "We have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain here
   forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who
   is this Son of Man?"

   ^35Jesus said to them,

   "You will have the light only a little while longer. Go on while you
   still have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you, for those
   who go about in the dark do not know where they are going.

   ^36While you have the light believe in the light, that you may become
   sons of light."

   With these words Jesus went away, and disappeared from them.

   ^37But for all the signs he had shown among them, they refused to
   believe in him,

   ^38in fulfilment of the saying of the prophet Isaiah,

   "Lord, who has believed our account?

   And to whom has the Lord's mighty arm been unveiled?"

   ^39So they could not believe; for Isaiah says again,

   ^40"He has made their eyes blind and their minds dull,

   To keep them from seeing with their eyes, and understanding with their
   minds,

   And turning to me to be cured."

   ^41Isaiah said this because he saw his glory; it was of him that he
   spoke.

   ^42Yet for all that, even among the leading men, many came to believe
   in him, but on account of the Pharisees they would not acknowledge it,
   for fear of being excluded from the synagogues,

   ^43for they cared more for the approval of men than for the approval of
   God.

   ^44But Jesus cried loudly,

   "Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who has sent me;

   ^45and whoever sees me, sees him who has sent me.

   ^46I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes
   in me may have to remain in darkness.

   ^47If anyone hears my words and disregards them, it is not I that judge
   him, for I have not come to judge the world but to save the world.

   ^48Whoever rejects me and refuses to accept my teachings is not without
   his judge; the very message I have given will be his judge on the Last
   Day,

   ^49for I have not spoken on my account, but the Father who has sent me
   has himself given me orders what to tell and what to say.

   ^50And I know his orders mean eternal life. So whatever I say, I say
   only as the Father has told me."

  Chapter 13

   ^1Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come
   for him to leave this world and go to the Father, but he had loved
   those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.

   ^2So at supper--the devil having by this time put the thought of
   betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son--

   ^3Jesus, fully aware that the Father had put everything into his hands,
   and that he had come from God and was going back to God,

   ^4rose from the table, took off his outer clothing, and fastened a
   towel about his waist.

   ^5Then he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples'
   feet, wiping them with the towel that was about his waist.

   ^6So he came to Simon Peter. He said to him,

   "Master, are you going to wash my feet?"

   ^7Jesus answered,

   "You cannot understand now what I am doing, but you will learn by and
   by."

   ^8Peter said to him,

   "I will never let you wash my feet!"

   Jesus answered,

   "You will have no share with me unless I wash you."

   ^9Simon Peter said to him,

   "Master, wash not only my feet but my hands and my face too!"

   ^10Jesus said to him,

   "Anyone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed to be
   altogether clean. And you are already clean--though not all of you."

   ^11For he knew who was going to betray him; that was why he said, "You
   are not all of you clean."

   ^12When he had washed their feet and put on his clothes and taken his
   place, he said to them again,

   "Do you understand what I have been doing to you?

   ^13You call me Teacher and Master, and you are right, for that is what
   I am.

   ^14If I then, your Master and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought
   to wash one another's feet too.

   ^15For I have set you an example, in order that you may do what I have
   done to you.

   ^16I tell you, no slave is superior to his master, and no messenger is
   greater than the man who sends him.

   ^17Now that you have this knowledge, you will be blessed if you act
   upon it.

   ^18I do not mean all of you; I know whom I have chosen; but let the
   Scripture be fulfilled:

   " He who is eating my bread

   Has raised his heel against me.'

   ^19From now on I will tell you things before they happen, so that when
   they do happen you may believe that I am what I say.

   ^20I assure you, whoever welcomes any messenger of mine welcomes me and
   whoever welcomes me welcomes him who has sent me."

   ^21After Jesus had said this he was greatly moved and said solemnly,

   "I tell you, it is one of you that will betray me!"

   ^22The disciples looked at one another in doubt as to which of them he
   meant.

   ^23Next to Jesus, at his right at the table, was one of his disciples
   whom Jesus especially loved.

   ^24So Simon Peter nodded to him and said to him,

   "Tell us whom he means."

   ^25He leaned back from where he lay, on Jesus' breast, and said to him,

   "Master, who is it?"

   ^26Jesus answered,

   "It is the one to whom I am going to give this piece of bread when I
   have dipped it in the dish." So he dipped the piece of bread and took
   it and gave it to Judas, Simon Iscariot's son.

   ^27After he took the bread, Satan took possession of him. Then Jesus
   said to him,

   "Be quick about your business."

   ^28But no one else at the table knew what he meant by telling him this,

   ^29for some of them thought that as Judas had the purse Jesus meant to
   say to him, "Buy what we need for the festival," or to have him give
   something to the poor.

   ^30So immediately after taking the piece of bread he went out. It was
   then night.

   ^31When he was gone, Jesus said,

   "Now the Son of Man has been honored, and God has been honored through
   him,

   ^32and God will through himself honor him; he will honor him
   immediately.

   ^33My children, I am to be with you only a little longer. You will look
   for me, but, as I said to the Jews, where I am going you cannot follow,

   ^34I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved
   you, you must love one another.

   ^35By this they will all know that you are my disciples--by your love
   for one another."

   ^36Simon Peter said to him,

   "Master, where are you going?"

   Jesus answered,

   "I am going where you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me
   later."

   ^37Peter said to him,

   "Master, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."

   ^38Jesus answered,

   "You will lay down your life for me? I tell you, before a cock crows,
   you will disown me thrice over!

  Chapter 14

   ^1"Your minds must not be troubled; you must believe in God, and
   believe in me.

   ^2There are many rooms in my Father's house; if there were not, I would
   have told you, for I am going away to make ready a place for you.

   ^3And if I go and make it ready, I will come back and take you with me,
   so that you may be where I am.

   ^4You know the way to the place where I am going."

   ^5Thomas said to him,

   "Master, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?"

   ^6Jesus said to him,

   "I am Way and Truth and Life. No one can come to the Father except
   through me.

   ^7If you knew me, you would know my Father also. From now on you do
   know him and you have seen him."

   ^8Philip said to him,

   "Master, let us see the Father, and it will satisfy us."

   ^9Jesus said to him,

   "Have I been with you so long, and yet you, Philip, have not recognized
   me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, Let us
   see the Father'?

   ^10Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father
   is in union with me? I am not the source of the words that I say to
   you, but the Father who is united with me is doing these things
   himself.

   ^11You must believe that I am in union with the Father and that the
   Father is in union with me, or else you must believe because of the
   things themselves.

   ^12I tell you, whoever believes in me will do such things as I do, and
   things greater yet, because I am going to the Father.

   ^13Anything you ask for as followers of mine I will grant, so that the
   Father may be honored through the Son.

   ^14I will grant anything you ask me for as my followers.

   ^15"If you really love me, you will observe my commands.

   ^16And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Helper to be
   with you always.

   ^17It is the Spirit of Truth. The world cannot obtain that Spirit,
   because it does not see it or recognize it; you recognize it because it
   stays with you and is within you.

   ^18I am not going to leave you friendless. I am coming back to you.

   ^19In a little while the world will not see me any more, but you will
   still see me, because I shall live on, and you will live on too.

   ^20When that day comes you will know that I am in union with my Father
   and you are with me and I am with you.

   ^21It is he who has my commands and observes them that really loves me,
   and whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him,
   and show myself to him."

   ^22Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said to him,

   "Master, how does it happen that you are going to show yourself to us
   and not to the world?"

   ^23Jesus answered,

   "Anyone who loves me will observe my teaching, and my Father will love
   him and we will come to him and live with him.

   ^24No one who does not love me will observe my teaching, and yet the
   teaching you are listening to is not mine but is that of him who has
   sent me.

   ^25"I have told you this while I am still staying with you,

   ^26but the Helper, the holy Spirit which the Father will send in my
   place, will teach you everything and remind you of everything that I
   have told you.

   ^27I leave you a blessing; I give you my own blessing. I do not give it
   to you as the world gives. Your minds must not be troubled or afraid.

   ^28You have heard me say that I am going away and am coming back to
   you; if you loved me you would be glad that I am going to the Father,
   for the Father is greater than I.

   ^29And I have told you of it now before it happens, in order that when
   it happens you may believe in me.

   ^30I shall not talk much more with you, for the evil genius of the
   world is coming. He has nothing in common with me,

   ^31but he is coming that the world may know that I love the Father and
   am doing what he has commanded me to do. Come, let us go away.

  Chapter 15

   ^1"I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator.

   ^2Any branch of mine that does not bear fruit he trims away, and he
   prunes every branch that bears fruit, to make it bear more.

   ^3You are pruned already because of the teaching that I have given you.

   ^4You must remain united to me and I will remain united to you. Just as
   no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains united to the
   vine, you cannot unless you remain united to me.

   ^5I am the vine, you are the branches. Anyone who remains united to me,
   with me united to him, will be very fruitful, for you cannot do
   anything apart from me.

   ^6Anyone who does not remain united to me is thrown away like a branch
   and withers up, and they gather them and throw them into the fire and
   burn them.

   ^7If you remain united to me and my words remain in your hearts, ask
   for whatever you please and you shall have it.

   ^8When you are very fruitful and show yourselves to be disciples of
   mine, my Father is honored.

   ^9I have loved you just as the Father has loved me. You must retain my
   love.

   ^10If you keep my commands you will retain my love, just as I have
   observed the Father's commands and retain his love.

   ^11I have told you all this so that you may have the happiness that I
   have had, and your happiness may be complete.

   ^12The command that I give you is to love one another just as I have
   loved you.

   ^13No one can show greater love than by giving up his life for his
   friends.

   ^14You are my friends if you do what I command you to do.

   ^15I do not call you slaves any longer, for a slave does not know what
   his master is doing, but now I call you friends, for I have made known
   to you everything that I have learned from my Father.

   ^16It was not you who chose me, it is I that have chosen you, and
   appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that shall be lasting, so
   that the Father may grant you whatever you ask him for as my followers.

   ^17"What I command you to do is to love one another.

   ^18If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.

   ^19If you belonged to the world, the world would love what was its own.
   But it is because you do not belong to the world, but I have selected
   you from the world, that the world hates you.

   ^20Remember what I said to you: No slave is greater than his master. If
   they have persecuted me they will persecute you too. If they have
   observed my teaching, they will observe yours too.

   ^21But they will do all this to you on my account, because they do not
   understand him who sent me.

   ^22If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been
   guilty of sin, but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin.

   ^23Whoever hates me hates my Father also.

   ^24If I had not done things before them that no one else ever did they
   would not be guilty of sin. But as it is, they have seen both me and my
   Father, and they have hated us both.

   ^25But the saying of their Law, They hated me without cause,' must be
   fulfilled.

   ^26When the Helper comes whom I will send to you from the Father--that
   Spirit of Truth that comes from the Father--he will bear testimony to
   me,

   ^27and you must bear testimony too, because you have been with me from
   the first.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   ^1"I have told you this to keep you from faltering.

   ^2They will exclude you from their synagogues; why, the time is coming
   when anyone who kills you will think he is doing religious service to
   God.

   ^3They will do this because they do not know the Father or me.

   ^4But I have told you about these things in order that when the time
   comes for them to happen, you may remember that I told you of them. I
   did not tell you this at first because I was still staying with you.

   ^5But now I am going away to him who sent me, and not one of you asks
   me where I am going,

   ^6but your minds are full of sorrow because I have told you this.

   ^7Yet it is only the truth when I tell you that it is better for you
   that I should go away. For if I do not go, the Helper will not come to
   you, but if I go I will send him to you.

   ^8When he comes, he will bring conviction to the world about sin and
   uprightness and judgment;

   ^9about sin, as shown in their not believing in me;

   ^10about uprightness, as shown by my going away to the Father, where
   you can no longer see me;

   ^11and about judgment, as shown by the condemnation of the evil genius
   of this world.

   ^12I have much more to tell you, but you cannot take it in now,

   ^13but when the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into the full
   truth, for he will not speak for himself but will tell what he hears,
   and will announce to you the things that are to come.

   ^14He will do honor to me, for he will take what is mine and
   communicate it to you.

   ^15All that the Father has belongs to me. That is why I said that he
   will take what is mine and communicate it to you.

   ^16"In a little while you will not see me any longer, and a little
   while after, you will see me again."

   ^17Then some of his disciples said to one another,

   "What does he mean when he tells us, In a little while you will not see
   me any longer, and a little while after, you will see me again,' and
   Because I am going away to the Father'?"

   ^18So they kept saying "What does he mean by In a little while'? We do
   not know what he is talking about."

   ^19Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him a question, and he said to
   them,

   "Are you asking one another about my saying In a little while you will
   not see me any longer, and a little while after, you will see me
   again'?

   ^20I tell you, you will weep and wail while the world will be happy;
   you will grieve, but your grief will change to happiness.

   ^21When a woman is in labor she is sorrowful, for her time has come;
   but when the child is born, she forgets her pain in her joy that a
   human being has been brought into the world.

   ^22So you, too, are sorrowful now; but I will see you again, and your
   hearts will be happy, and no one will rob you of your happiness.

   ^23When that time comes, you will not ask me any questions; I tell you,
   whatever you ask the Father for, he will give you as my followers.

   ^24Hitherto you have not asked for anything as my followers, but now
   ask, and you will receive, so that your happiness may be complete.

   ^25"I have said all this to you in figurative language, but a time is
   coming when I shall not do so any longer, but will tell you plainly
   about the Father.

   ^26When that time comes you will ask as my followers, and I do not
   promise to intercede with the Father for you,

   ^27for the Father loves you himself because you love me and believe
   that I have come from the Father.

   ^28I did come from the Father and enter the world. Now I am leaving the
   world again and going back to the Father."

   ^29His disciples said,

   "Why, now you are talking plainly and not speaking figuratively at all.

   ^30Now we know that you know everything and do not need to have anyone
   ask you questions. This makes us believe that you have really come from
   God."

   ^31Jesus answered,

   "Do you believe that now?

   ^32Why, a time is coming--it has already come!--when you will all be
   scattered to your homes and will leave me alone. And yet I am not
   alone, for the Father is with me.

   ^33I have told you all this, so that through me you may find peace. In
   the world you have trouble; but take courage! I have conquered the
   world."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   ^1When Jesus had said all this he raised his eyes to heaven and said,

   "Father, the time has come. Do honor to your son, that your son may do
   honor to you,

   ^2just as you have done in giving him power over all mankind, so that
   he may give eternal life to all whom you have given him.

   ^3And eternal life means knowing you as the only true God, and knowing
   Jesus your messenger as Christ.

   ^4I have done honor to you here on earth, by completing the work which
   you gave me to do.

   ^5Now, Father, do such honor to me in your presence as I had done me
   there before the world existed.

   ^6"I have revealed your real self to the men you gave me from the
   world. They were yours and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed
   your message.

   ^7Now at last they know that all that you have given me comes from you,

   ^8for I have given them the truths that you gave me, and they have
   accepted them and been convinced that I came from you, and they believe
   that you sent me.

   ^9I have a request to make for them. I make no request for the world,
   but only for those whom you have given me, for they are yours--

   ^10all that is mine is yours and what is yours is mine--and they have
   done me honor.

   ^11Now I am to be no longer in this world, but they are to remain in
   the world, while I return to you. Holy Father, keep them by your power
   which you gave me, so that they may be one just as we are.

   ^12As long as I was with them I kept them by your power which you gave
   me, and I protected them, and not one of them was lost (except the one
   who was destined to be lost), so that what the Scripture says might
   come true.

   ^13But now I am coming to you, and I say this here in this world in
   order that they may have the happiness that I feel fully realized in
   their own hearts.

   ^14I have given them your message, and the world has come to hate them,
   for they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the
   world.

   ^15I do not ask you to take them away from the world, but to keep them
   from evil.

   ^16They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world.

   ^17Consecrate them by truth. Your message is truth.

   ^18Just as you sent me to the world, I have sent them to the world.

   ^19And it is for their sake that I consecrate myself, that they also
   may be consecrated by truth.

   ^20"It is not for them only that I make this request. It is also for
   those who through their message come to believe in me.

   ^21Let them all be one. Just as you, Father, are in union with me and I
   am with you, let them be in union with us, so that the world may
   believe that you sent me.

   ^22I have given them the glory that you gave me, so that they may be
   one just as we are,

   ^23I in union with them and you with me, so that they may be perfectly
   unified, and the world may recognize that you sent me and that you love
   them just as you loved me.

   ^24Father, I wish to have those whom you have given me with me where I
   am, to see my glory that you have given me, for you loved me before the
   creation of the world.

   ^25Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you, and
   these men knew that you had sent me.

   ^26I have made your self known to them and I will do so still, so that
   the love which you have had for me may be in their hearts, and I may be
   there also."

  Chapter 18

   ^1When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples to the other
   side of the Ravine of the Cedars where there was a garden, and he went
   into it with his disciples.

   ^2Judas who betrayed him also knew the place, for Jesus often met his
   disciples there.

   ^3So Judas got out the garrison and some attendants from the high
   priests and Pharisees, and came there with lanterns, torches, and
   weapons.

   ^4Then Jesus, as he knew everything that was going to happen to him,
   came forward and said to them,

   "Who is it you are looking for?"

   ^5They answered,

   "Jesus of Nazareth."

   He said to them,

   "I am he."

   Judas who betrayed him was standing among them.

   ^6When Jesus said to them, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the
   ground.

   ^7Then he asked them again,

   "Who is it you are looking for?"

   They said,

   "Jesus of Nazareth."

   ^8Jesus answered,

   "I have told you that I am he, so if you are looking for me, let these
   men go."

   ^9This was to fulfil the saying he had uttered, "I have not lost one of
   those whom you have given me."

   ^10Then Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it and struck at
   the high priest's slave and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was
   Malchus.

   ^11Then Jesus said to Peter,

   "Put your sword back into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which
   the Father has offered me?"

   ^12So the garrison and the colonel and the attendants of the Jews
   seized Jesus and bound him,

   ^13and they took him first to Annas. For he was the father-in-law of
   Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.

   ^14Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was for their
   interest that one man should die for the people.

   ^15But Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. This other
   disciple was an acquaintance of the high priest, and he went on with
   Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,

   ^16while Peter stood outside at the door. So this other disciple, the
   acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman at the
   door and brought Peter in.

   ^17The maid at the door said to Peter,

   "Are you also one of this man's disciples?"

   He said,

   "No, I am not."

   ^18As it was cold the slaves and attendants had made a charcoal fire,
   and stood about it warming themselves. And Peter also was among them,
   standing and warming himself.

   ^19Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his
   teaching.

   ^20Jesus answered,

   "I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues
   or in the Temple where all the Jews meet together, and I have said
   nothing in secret.

   ^21Why do you question me? Ask those who have heard me what it was that
   I said to them. They will know what I have said."

   ^22When he said this, one of the attendants who stood near struck him
   and said,

   "Is that the way you answer the high priest?"

   ^23Jesus replied,

   "If I have said anything wrong, testify to it; but if what I have said
   is true, why do you strike me?"

   ^24So Annas sent him over still bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

   ^25But Simon Peter still stood warming himself. So they said to him,

   "Are you also one of his disciples?"

   He denied it and said,

   "No, I am not."

   ^26One of the high priest's slaves, a relative of the man whose ear
   Peter had cut off, said,

   "Did I not see you with him in the garden?"

   ^27Peter again denied it, and at that moment a cock crowed.

   ^28Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's house. It was
   early in the morning, and they would not go into the governor's house
   themselves, to avoid being ceremonially defiled and to be able to eat
   the Passover supper.

   ^29So Pilate came outside to them, and said,

   "What charge do you make against this man?"

   ^30They answered,

   "If he were not a criminal, we would not have turned him over to you."

   ^31Pilate said to them,

   "Take him yourselves, and try him by your law."

   The Jews said to him,

   "We have no authority to put anyone to death."

   ^32This was to fulfil what Jesus said when he declared how he was to
   die.

   ^33So Pilate went back into the governor's house and called Jesus and
   said to him,

   "Are you the king of the Jews?"

   ^34Jesus answered,

   "Did you think of that yourself, or has someone else said it to you
   about me?"

   ^35Pilate answered,

   "Do you take me for a Jew? Your own people and the high priests handed
   you over to me. What offense have you committed?"

   ^36Jesus answered,

   "My kingdom is not a kingdom of this world. If my kingdom were a
   kingdom of this world, my men would have fought to keep me from being
   handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom has no such origin."

   ^37Pilate said to him,

   "Then you are a king?"

   Jesus answered,

   "As you say, I am a king. It was for this that I was born and for this
   that I came to the world, to give testimony for truth. Everyone who is
   on the side of truth listens to my voice."

   ^38Pilate said to him,

   "What is truth!"

   With these words he went outside again to the Jews, and said to them,

   "I can find nothing to charge him with.

   ^39But it is your custom to have me release one man for you at Passover
   time. Do you want me therefore to release the king of the Jews for
   you?"

   ^40Then they shouted back,

   "No! Not him, but Barabbas!"

   Now Barabbas was a robber.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   ^1Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.

   ^2And the soldiers made a wreath out of thorns and put it on his head,
   and put a purple coat on him, and they marched up to him,

   ^3saying,

   "Long live the king of the Jews!" each one giving him a blow.

   ^4And Pilate went outside again and said to the Jews,

   "See! I will bring him out to you, to show you that I can find nothing
   to charge him with."

   ^5So Jesus came out, still wearing the wreath of thorns and the purple
   coat. And Pilate said to them,

   "Here is the man!"

   ^6When the high priests and their attendants saw him, they shouted,

   "Have him crucified! Have him crucified!"

   Pilate said to them,

   "Take him yourselves and have him crucified, for I can find nothing to
   charge him with."

   ^7The Jews answered,

   "We have a law, and by our law he deserves death, for declaring himself
   to be a son of God."

   ^8When Pilate heard that, he was more frightened than before

   ^9and he went back into the governor's house and said to Jesus,

   "Where do you come from?"

   But Jesus made no answer.

   ^10Then Pilate said to him,

   "Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that it is in my power
   to release you or to have you crucified?"

   ^11Jesus answered him,

   "You would have no power at all over me, if it were not given to you
   from above. So you are less guilty than the man who betrayed me to
   you."

   ^12This made Pilate try to find a way to let him go, but the Jews
   shouted,

   "If you let him go, you are no friend of the emperor's! Anyone who
   calls himself a king utters treason against the emperor!"

   ^13When Pilate heard that, he had Jesus brought out and had him sit in
   the judge's seat in the place they call the Stone Platform, or in
   Hebrew, Gabbatha.

   ^14It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and it was about
   noon. And Pilate said to the Jews,

   "There is your king!"

   ^15At that they shouted,

   "Kill him! Kill him! Have him crucified!"

   Pilate said to them,

   "Am I to crucify your king?"

   The high priests answered,

   "We have no king but the emperor!"

   ^16Then Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.

   So they took Jesus,

   ^17and he went out carrying the cross by himself to a spot called the
   Place of the Skull, or in Hebrew, Golgotha.

   ^18There they crucified him, with two others, one on each side and
   Jesus in the middle.

   ^19Pilate had written a placard and had it put on the cross; it read
   "Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews."

   ^20Many of the Jews read this placard, for the place where Jesus was
   crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and
   Greek.

   ^21So the Jewish high priests said to Pilate,

   "Do not write The king of the Jews,' but write He said, I am the king
   of the Jews.' "

   ^22Pilate answered,

   "What I have written, I have written!"

   ^23When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and
   divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, besides his shirt.
   Now his shirt had no seam; it was woven in one piece from top to
   bottom.

   ^24So they said to one another,

   "Let us not tear it, but let us draw for it, to see who gets it." This
   was to fulfil what the Scripture says:

   "They divided my garments among them,

   And for my clothing they cast lots."

   This was what the soldiers did.

   ^25Near Jesus' cross stood his mother and her sister Mary, the daughter
   of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.

   ^26So Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing
   near, said to his mother,

   "There is your son!"

   ^27Then he said to his disciple,

   "There is your mother!"

   And from that time his disciple took her into his home.

   ^28After that, Jesus, knowing that everything was now finished, to
   fulfil the saying of Scripture, said,

   "I am thirsty."

   ^29A bowl of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge soaked
   in the wine on a pike and held it to his lips.

   ^30When Jesus had taken the wine, he said,

   "It is finished!"

   Then bowing his head he gave up his spirit.

   ^31As it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, in order that the
   bodies might not be left on the crosses over the Sabbath, for that
   Sabbath was an especially important one, the Jews asked Pilate to have
   the men's legs broken and the bodies removed.

   ^32So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and then of
   the other who had been crucified with him.

   ^33But when they came to Jesus they saw that he was dead already, and
   they did not break his legs,

   ^34but one of the soldiers thrust a lance into his side, and blood and
   water immediately flowed out.

   ^35The man who saw it testifies to it--his testimony is true; he knows
   that he is telling the truth--to lead you also to believe.

   ^36For this happened to fulfil what the Scripture says:

   "Not one of its bones will be broken."

   ^37Moreover, it says in another place,

   "They shall look at the man whom they pierced."

   ^38After this, Joseph, of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but a
   secret one, because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him
   remove Jesus' body, and Pilate gave him permission. So Joseph went and
   took the body down.

   ^39And Nicodemus also, who had first come to Jesus at night, went,
   taking a roll of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.

   ^40So they took Jesus' body, and wrapped it with the spices in
   bandages, in the Jewish way of preparing bodies for burial.

   ^41There was a garden at the place where Jesus had been crucified, and
   in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.

   ^42So because it was the Jewish Preparation day, and the tomb was close
   by, they put Jesus there.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 20

   ^1On the day after the Sabbath, very early in the morning while it was
   still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and she saw that the
   stone had been removed from it.

   ^2So she ran away and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple who
   was dear to Jesus, and said to them,

   "They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where
   they have put him."

   ^3So Peter and the other disciple went out of the city and started for
   the tomb.

   ^4And they both ran, and the other disciple ran faster than Peter and
   got to the tomb first.

   ^5And he stooped down and saw the bandages lying on the ground, but he
   did not go in.

   ^6Then Simon Peter came up behind him, and he went inside the tomb, and
   saw the bandages lying on the ground,

   ^7and the handkerchief that had been over Jesus' face not on the ground
   with the bandages, but folded up by itself.

   ^8Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went inside
   too, and saw and was convinced.

   ^9For they did not yet understand the statement of Scripture that he
   must rise from the dead.

   ^10So the disciples went home again.

   ^11But Mary stood just outside the tomb, weeping. And as she wept she
   looked down into the tomb,

   ^12and saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus' body had been, one
   at his head and one at his feet.

   ^13And they said to her,

   "Why are you weeping?"

   She said to them,

   "They have taken my Master away, and I do not know where they have put
   him."

   ^14As she said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but
   she did not know that it was he.

   ^15Jesus said to her,

   "Why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?"

   She, supposing that he was the gardener, said to him,

   "If it was you, sir, that carried him away, tell me where you have put
   him, and I will take him away."

   ^16"Mary!" said Jesus.

   She turned and said to him in Hebrew,

   "Rabbouni!" which means Master.

   ^17Jesus said to her,

   "You must not cling to me, for I have not yet gone up to my Father, but
   go to my brothers and say to them that I am going up to my Father and
   your Father, to my God and your God."

   ^18Mary of Magdala went and declared to the disciples,

   "I have seen the Master!" and she told them that he had said this to
   her.

   ^19When it was evening on that first day after the Sabbath, and the
   doors of the house where the disciples met were locked for fear of the
   Jews, Jesus came in and stood among them and said to them,

   "Peace be with you!"

   ^20Then he showed them his hands and his side, and the disciples were
   full of joy at seeing the Master.

   ^21Jesus said to them again,

   "Peace be with you! Just as my Father sent me forth so I now send you."

   ^22As he said this he breathed upon them, and said,

   ^23"Receive the holy Spirit! If you forgive any men's sins, they are
   forgiven them, and if you fix any men's sins upon them, they will
   remain fixed."

   ^24But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called the Twin, was not with
   them when Jesus came in.

   ^25So the rest of the disciples said to him,

   "We have seen the Master!"

   But he said to them,

   "Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands, and put my finger
   into them, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it!"

   ^26A week after, the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was
   with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came in and stood
   among them, and said,

   "Peace be with you!"

   ^27Then he said to Thomas,

   "Put your finger here and look at my hands, and take your hand and put
   it in my side, and be no longer unbelieving, but believe!"

   ^28Thomas answered him,

   "My Master and my God!"

   ^29Jesus said to him,

   "Is it because you have seen me that you believe? Blessed be those who
   believe without having seen me!"

   ^30There were many other signs that Jesus showed before his disciples
   which are not recorded in this book.

   ^31But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is
   the Christ, the Son of God, and through believing you may have life as
   his followers.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 21

   ^1After this Jesus again showed himself to the disciples at the Sea of
   Tiberias, and he did so in this way.

   ^2Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael, of Cana in Galilee,
   the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus were all
   together.

   ^3Simon Peter said to them,

   "I am going fishing."

   They said to him,

   "We will go with you."

   They went out and got into the boat, and that night they caught
   nothing.

   ^4But just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, though the
   disciples did not know that it was he.

   ^5So Jesus said to them,

   "Children, have you any fish?"

   They answered,

   "No."

   ^6"Throw your net in on the right of the boat," he said to them, "and
   you will find them."

   They did so, and they could not haul it in for the quantity of fish in
   it.

   ^7Then the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter,

   "It is the Master!"

   When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he put on his clothes,
   for he had taken them off, and sprang into the sea.

   ^8The rest of the disciples followed in the boat, for they were not far
   from land, only about a hundred yards, dragging in the net full of
   fish.

   ^9When they landed they saw a charcoal fire burning, with a fish on it,
   and some bread.

   ^10Jesus said to them,

   "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."

   ^11So Simon Peter got into the boat, and hauled the net ashore, full of
   large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them, and though there were so
   many, the net was not torn.

   ^12Jesus said to them,

   "Come and have breakfast."

   None of the disciples dared to ask him who he was, for they knew it was
   the Master.

   ^13Jesus went and got the bread and gave it to them, and the fish also.

   ^14This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples,
   after he had risen from the dead.

   ^15When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,

   "Simon, son of John, are you more devoted to me than these others are?"

   Peter said to him,

   "Yes, Master, you know that I love you."

   Jesus said to him,

   "Then feed my lambs!"

   ^16Again Jesus said to him a second time,

   "Simon, son of John, are you devoted to me?"

   He said to him,

   "Yes, Master, you know that I love you."

   Jesus said to him,

   "Then be a shepherd to my sheep!"

   ^17Jesus said to him a third time,

   "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

   Peter was hurt because the third time Jesus asked him if he loved him,
   and he answered,

   "Master, you know everything, you can see that I love you."

   Jesus said to him,

   "Then feed my sheep!

   ^18I tell you, when you were young, you used to put on your own girdle
   and go where you pleased, but when you grow old, you will stretch our
   your hands and someone else will put a girdle on you and take you where
   you have no wish to go"

   ^19He said this to show the kind of death by which Peter was to honor
   God; and after he had said it he said to Peter,

   "Follow me!"

   ^20Peter turned and saw following them the disciple who was very dear
   to Jesus, who at the supper leaned back on Jesus' breast and said,
   "Master, who is it that is going to betray you?"

   ^21When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus,

   "But, Master, what about him?"

   ^22Jesus said to him,

   "If I wish him to wait till I come, what does it matter to you? You
   must follow me."

   ^23So the story spread among the brothers that this disciple was not
   going to die. But Jesus did not tell him that he was not going to die;
   he said, "If I wish him to wait till I come, what does it matter to
   you?"

   ^24It is this disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them
   down, and we know that his testimony is true.

   ^25There are many other things that Jesus did, so many in fact that if
   they were all written out, I do not suppose that the world itself would
   hold the books that would have to be written.

The Acts of the Apostles
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1In my first volume, Theophilus, I dealt with all that Jesus did and
   taught from the beginning

   ^2until the day when through the holy Spirit he gave the apostles he
   had chosen their instructions, and was taken up to heaven.

   ^3He had shown himself alive to them after he had suffered, in many
   convincing ways, appearing to them through forty days, and telling them
   about the Kingdom of God.

   ^4And once when he ate with them, he instructed them not to leave
   Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised.

   "You have heard me speak of it," he said,

   ^5"for John baptized people in water, but in a few days you will be
   baptized in the holy Spirit."

   ^6So those who were present asked him,

   "Master, is this the time when you are going to re-establish the
   kingdom for Israel?"

   ^7He said to them,

   "It is not for you to know times and dates which the Father has fixed
   by his own authority,

   ^8but you will be given power when the holy Spirit comes upon you, and
   you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and all over Judea and
   Samaria and to the very ends of the earth."

   ^9As he said this, he was caught up before their eyes and a cloud took
   him up from their sight.

   ^10And while they were gazing after him into the sky, two men dressed
   in white suddenly stood beside them,

   ^11and said to them,

   "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into the sky? This very
   Jesus who has been caught up from you into heaven will come in just the
   way that you have seen him go up to heaven."

   ^12Then they went back to Jerusalem from the hill called the
   Olive-orchard, which is near Jerusalem, half a mile away.

   ^13When they entered the city they went to the upstairs room where they
   were staying. There were Peter, John, James and Andrew, Philip and
   Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, the son of Alpheus, Simon the
   Zealot, and Judas, the son of James.

   ^14They were all devoting themselves with one mind to prayer, with the
   women and Mary, Jesus' mother, and his brothers.

   ^15It was at that time that Peter got up among the brothers--there were
   about a hundred and twenty persons present--and said,

   ^16"Brothers, the prediction of the Scriptures had to come true that
   the holy Spirit uttered by the lips of David, about Judas, who acted as
   guide for the men that arrested Jesus--

   ^17for he was one of our number and a share in this ministry of ours
   fell to his lot."

   ^18(This man bought a piece of land with the money paid him for his
   treachery, and his body swelled up and burst open in the middle and all
   his vitals poured out.

   ^19This fact was well known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that
   the piece of land came to be called in their language Akeldamach, the
   bloody field.)

   ^20"For in the Book of Psalms it is written,

   Let his estate be desolate, with no one to live on it,'

   and

   Let someone else take his position.'

   ^21"So one of the men who has been associated with us all the time that
   the Lord Jesus moved about among us,

   ^22from his baptism by John to the time when he was caught up from us,
   must join us as a witness to his resurrection."

   ^23Then they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was known
   as Justus, and Matthias.

   ^24And they prayed, saying,

   "Lord, you who know all hearts, show us which one of these two you have
   chosen

   ^25to take this place of service as an apostle which Judas left to go
   where he belonged."

   ^26Then they drew lots between them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and
   he was added to the eleven apostles.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1On the day of the Harvest Festival, they were all meeting together,

   ^2when suddenly there came from the sky a sound like a violent blast of
   wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.

   ^3And they saw tongues like flames separating and settling one on the
   head of each of them,

   ^4and they were all filled with the holy Spirit and began to say in
   foreign languages whatever the Spirit prompted them to utter.

   ^5Now there were devout Jews from every part of the world living in
   Jerusalem.

   ^6And when this sound was heard, the crowd gathered in great
   excitement, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.

   ^7They were perfectly amazed and said in their astonishment,

   "Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?

   ^8Then how is it that each of us hears his own native tongue?

   ^9Parthians, Medes, Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia, of Judea and
   Cappadocia, of Pontus, and Asia,

   ^10of Phrygia, and Pamphylia, of Egypt and the district of Africa about
   Cyrene, visitors from Rome, Jews and proselytes,

   ^11Cretans and Arabs--we all hear them tell in our native tongues the
   mighty deeds of God."

   ^12And they were all amazed and bewildered and said to one another,

   "What can this mean?"

   ^13But others said derisively,

   "They have had too much new wine!"

   ^14Then Peter stood up with the eleven around him, and raising his
   voice addressed them.

   "Men of Judea," he said, "and all you residents of Jerusalem, let me
   explain this to you, and pay attention to what I say.

   ^15These men are not drunk as you suppose, for it is only nine in the
   morning.

   ^16But this is what was predicted by the prophet Joel,

   ^17" It will come about in the last days, God says,

   That I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind;

   Your sons and daughters will become prophets,

   Your young men will have visions,

   And your old men will have dreams.

   ^18Even on my slaves, both men and women,

   I will pour out my Spirit in those days,

   And they will become prophets.

   ^19I will show wonders in the sky above,

   And signs on the earth below,

   Blood and fire and thick smoke.

   ^20The sun will turn to darkness,

   And the moon to blood,

   Before the coming of the great, splendid Day of the Lord.

   ^21Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'

   ^22"Men of Israel, listen to what I say. Jesus of Nazareth, as you
   know, was a man whom God commended to you by the wonders, portents, and
   signs that God did right among you through him.

   ^23But you, by the fixed purpose and intention of God, handed him over
   to wicked men, and had him crucified.

   ^24But God set aside the pain of death and raised him up, for death
   could not control him.

   ^25For David says of him,

   I constantly regarded the Lord before me,

   For he is at my right hand, so that I may not be displaced.

   ^26Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices,

   And my body will still live in hope.

   ^27For you will not desert my soul in death,

   You will not let your Holy One be destroyed.

   ^28You have made the ways of life known to me,

   And you will fill me with joy in your presence.'

   ^29"Brothers, one may say to you confidently of the patriarch David
   that he died and was buried, and his grave is here among us to this
   very day.

   ^30But as he was a prophet, and knew that God had promised him with an
   oath that he would put one of his descendants upon his throne,

   ^31he foresaw the resurrection of the Christ and told of it, for he was
   not deserted in death and his body was not destroyed.

   ^32He is Jesus, whom God raised from the dead, and to whose
   resurrection we are all witnesses.

   ^33So he has been exalted to God's right hand, and has received from
   his Father and poured over us the holy Spirit that had been promised,
   as you see and hear.

   ^34"For David did not go up to heaven, but he said,

   The Lord said to my lord, Sit at my right hand,

   ^35Until I make your enemies your footstool.'

   ^36"Therefore the whole nation of Israel must understand that God has
   declared this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ."

   ^37When they heard this, they were stung to the heart, and they said to
   Peter and the rest of the apostles,

   "Brothers, what shall we do?"

   ^38Peter said to them,

   "You must repent, and every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus
   Christ, in order to have your sins forgiven; then you will receive the
   gift of the holy Spirit,

   ^39for the promise of it belongs to you and your children, as well as
   to all those far away whom the Lord our God calls to him."

   ^40He said much more besides in giving his testimony, and urged them to
   save themselves from that crooked age.

   ^41So they welcomed his message and were baptized, and about three
   thousand people joined them that day.

   ^42And they devoted themselves to the teaching and the society of the
   apostles, the breaking of bread, and prayer.

   ^43Everyone felt a sense of awe, and many wonders and signs were done
   by the apostles.

   ^44The believers all shared everything they had with one another,

   ^45and sold their property and belongings, and divided the money with
   all the rest, according to their special needs.

   ^46Day after day they all went regularly to the Temple, they broke
   their bread together in their homes, and they ate their food with glad
   and simple hearts,

   ^47constantly praising God and respected by all the people. And every
   day the Lord added people who were saved to their number.

  Chapter 3

   ^1Peter and John were on their way up to the Temple for the three
   o'clock hour of prayer,

   ^2when a man who had been lame from his birth was carried by. He used
   to be placed every day at what was known as the Beautiful Gate of the
   Temple, to beg from the people on their way into the Temple,

   ^3and when he saw Peter and John on the point of going into the Temple
   he asked them to give him something.

   ^4Peter fixed his eyes on him, as John did also, and said to him,

   "Look at us!"

   ^5He looked at them, supposing that they were going to give him
   something.

   ^6But Peter said,

   "I have no silver or gold, but I will give you what I have. In the name
   of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!"

   ^7And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and his feet and
   ankles immediately became strong,

   ^8and he sprang to his feet and began to walk, and he went into the
   Temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.

   ^9When all the people saw him walking about, praising God,

   ^10and recognized him as the man who used to sit and beg at the
   Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were perfectly astonished and amazed
   at what had happened to him.

   ^11And as he still clung to Peter and John, all the people crowded
   about them in the utmost astonishment in what was known as Solomon's
   Colonnade.

   ^12When Peter saw this, he said to the people.

   "Men of Israel, why are you so surprised at this? Why do you stare so
   at us, as though it were some power or some piety of ours that had made
   him able to walk?

   ^13The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers,
   has done this honor to his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and
   disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to let him go.

   ^14But you disowned the Holy, Righteous One. You asked to have a
   murderer released for you,

   ^15and killed the very source of life. But God raised him from the
   dead, as we can testify.

   ^16It is by his power and through faith in him that this man whom you
   see and recognize has been made strong again, and it is faith inspired
   by him that has given him the perfect health you all see.

   ^17Yet I know, brothers, that you did not know what you were doing, any
   more than your leaders did;

   ^18it was in this way that God fulfilled what he by all the prophets
   foretold that his Christ must suffer.

   ^19So repent and turn to God, to have your sins wiped out, and happier
   times will come from the presence of the Lord,

   ^20and he will send Jesus, your destined Christ.

   ^21Yet he must remain in heaven till the time for the universal
   reformation of which God told in ancient times by the lips of his holy
   prophets.

   ^22Moses said, The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among
   your brothers, as he raised me up. You must listen to everything that
   he tells you.

   ^23Anyone that will not listen to that prophet will be annihilated from
   among the people.'

   ^24Why, all the prophets from Samuel down, who have spoken, have also
   foretold these days.

   ^25You are the descendants of the prophets and the heirs of the
   agreement that God made with your forefathers when he said to Abraham,
   Through your posterity all the families of the earth will be blessed.'

   ^26It was to you that God first sent his servant after he had raised
   him from the dead, to bless you by making every one of you turn from
   his wickedness."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1As they were talking in this way to the people, the high priests, the
   commander of the Temple, and the Sadducees came up to them,

   ^2greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and declaring
   that in the case of Jesus there had been a resurrection from the dead.

   ^3They arrested them, and as it was already evening, they shut them up
   until next morning.

   ^4But many of those who had heard what they said believed it, and their
   number grew to be about five thousand.

   ^5On the next day the leading members of the council, the elders, and
   the scribes met in Jerusalem,

   ^6with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who
   belonged to the high priest's family.

   ^7They had the apostles brought before them and demanded of them,

   "By what power or authority have men like you done this?"

   ^8Then Peter, filled with the holy Spirit, said to them,

   "Leaders of the people and members of the council,

   ^9if it is for a benefit conferred upon a helpless man, and as to how
   he was cured, that we are called to account here today,

   ^10you and the people of Israel must all know that it is through the
   power of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified but whom God
   raised from the dead, that he stands here before you well.

   ^11He is the stone that you builders rejected, which has become the
   cornerstone.

   ^12There is no salvation through anyone else, for there is no one else
   in the world who has been named to men as their only means of being
   saved."

   ^13They were amazed to see how outspoken Peter and John were, and to
   find that they were uneducated men with no advantages. They recognized
   them as companions of Jesus,

   ^14and seeing the man who had been cured standing beside them, they had
   nothing to say.

   ^15But they ordered them out of the presence of the council and
   conferred together.

   ^16They said,

   "What are we to do with these men? For it is plain to everyone in
   Jerusalem that an extraordinary wonder has been done by them. We cannot
   deny that.

   ^17But to keep it from spreading farther among the people, let us warn
   them to say nothing to anyone else at all about this person."

   ^18So they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all
   about the name of Jesus.

   ^19But Peter and John answered them,

   "You must decide whether it is right in the sight of God to obey you
   instead of him,

   ^20for we cannot help telling of what we have seen and heard."

   ^21But after further threats they let them go, as they could find no
   way to punish them, on account of the people, who were all giving honor
   to God for what had happened,

   ^22for the man on whom this wonder of healing had been done was more
   than forty years old.

   ^23After being released, the apostles went back to their friends, and
   told them what the high priests and members of the council had said to
   them.

   ^24When they heard it, with one impulse they all raised their voices to
   God and said,

   "Master, it was you who made heaven, earth, and sea, and everything
   that is in them,

   ^25and who said through the holy Spirit by the lips of our forefather
   David, your slave,

   " Why did the heathen rage,

   And the peoples form vain designs?

   ^26The kings of the earth stood by,

   And the rulers assembled

   Against the Lord and against his Christ.'

   ^27For they have assembled here in this city against your holy servant
   Jesus, whom you had consecrated--Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
   heathen and the peoples of Israel,

   ^28to carry out what your hand and will had destined should happen.

   ^29And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and give your slaves the
   power to utter your message fearlessly,

   ^30when you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are
   done by the power of your holy servant Jesus."

   ^31When they had prayed, the place where they were meeting shook, and
   they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and fearlessly uttered God's
   message.

   ^32There was but one heart and soul in the multitude who had become
   believers, and not one of them claimed anything that belonged to him as
   his own, but they shared everything they had with one another.

   ^33The apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord
   Jesus with great power, and God's favor rested richly upon them.

   ^34No one among them was in any want, for any who owned lands or houses
   would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sale

   ^35and put them at the disposal of the apostles; then they were shared
   with everyone in proportion to his need.

   ^36Joseph, a Levite, and a native of Cyprus, whom the apostles had
   named Barnabas, which means Son of Encouragement,

   ^37sold a piece of land that belonged to him, and brought the proceeds
   and put them at the disposal of the apostles.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1But a man named Ananias, who, with his wife Sapphira, had sold a
   piece of property,

   ^2with his wife's connivance appropriated some of the price received,
   and brought only a part of it to put at the disposal of the apostles.

   ^3And Peter said,

   "Ananias, why has Satan taken such possession of your heart that you
   should lie to the holy Spirit, by appropriating part of the price of
   your land?

   ^4As long as it was unsold was it not yours, and after it was sold was
   not the money under your control? How could you think of doing such a
   thing? You did not lie to men but to God!"

   ^5When Ananias heard these words he fell down and expired, and everyone
   who heard them spoken was appalled.

   ^6The younger men got up and wrapping his body up carried it out and
   buried it.

   ^7About three hours later, his wife came in, without having learned
   what had happened.

   ^8Peter said to her,

   "Tell me, did you sell the land for such and such a sum?"

   "Yes," she said, "that was it."

   ^9Peter said to her,

   "How could you two agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? There at the
   door are the footsteps of the men who buried your husband, and they
   will carry you out also."

   ^10She instantly fell down at his feet and expired. When the young men
   came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her
   beside her husband.

   ^11And the whole church and all who heard this were appalled.

   ^12They would all meet together in Solomon's Colonnade.

   ^13None of the others dared to associate with them, but the people made
   much of them,

   ^14and men and women in increasing numbers believed in the Lord and
   joined them.

   Signs and wonders in great numbers continued to be done among the
   people by the apostles,

   ^15so that people would carry their sick out into the streets, and lay
   them down on beds and mats, to have at least Peter's shadow fall on
   some of them as he went by.

   ^16Even from the towns around Jerusalem crowds would come in bringing
   sick people and those who were troubled with foul spirits, and they
   were all cured.

   ^17This aroused the high priest and all his supporters, the party of
   the Sadducees, and filled them with jealousy,

   ^18and they had the apostles arrested and put in the common jail.

   ^19But an angel of the Lord opened the jail doors in the night and let
   them out, and said to them,

   ^20"Go, take your stand in the Temple, and tell the people all about
   this new life."

   ^21And they obeyed, and about daybreak went into the Temple and began
   to teach. The high priest and his party came over and called together
   the council and indeed the whole senate of the Israelites, and sent to
   the prison to have the apostles brought in.

   ^22But the attendants who went for them could not find them in the
   jail, and they came back and reported,

   ^23"We found the prison securely locked up, with the sentries on duty
   at the doors, but on opening the doors we found no one inside."

   ^24When the commander of the Temple and the high priests heard this
   report, they were very much at a loss as to what would come of it.

   ^25Someone came over and reported to them,

   "The men that you put in jail are standing right here in the Temple,
   teaching the people!"

   ^26Then the commander and his men went and brought them back, but
   without using violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the
   people.

   ^27So they brought them before the council. The high priest called on
   them for an explanation.

   ^28"We strictly forbade you," he said, "to teach on this authority, and
   here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and propose to hold
   us responsible for this man's death!"

   ^29Peter and the apostles answered,

   "We must obey God rather than men.

   ^30The God of our forefathers raised Jesus to life when you had hung
   him on a cross and killed him.

   ^31God took him up to his right hand as our leader and savior, in order
   to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.

   ^32We and the holy Spirit which God has given to those who obey him are
   witnesses to these things."

   ^33When they heard this, they were furious, and wanted to kill them.

   ^34But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law highly regarded
   by all the people, got up in the council and ordered the men to be
   removed for a while,

   ^35and then said,

   "Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.

   ^36For some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be a person of
   importance, and a group of men numbering some four hundred joined him.
   But he was killed and all his followers were dispersed and disappeared.

   ^37After him, at the time of the census, Judas of Galilee appeared, and
   raised a great following, but he too perished, and all his followers
   were scattered.

   ^38So in the present case, I tell you, keep away from these men and let
   them alone, for if this idea or movement is of human origin, it will
   come to naught,

   ^39but if it is from God, you will not be able to stop it. You may
   actually find yourselves fighting God!"

   ^40They were convinced by him, and they called the apostles in and had
   them flogged, and warned them not to speak about the name of Jesus, and
   then let them go.

   ^41So they went out from before the council, glad that they had been
   thought worthy to bear disgrace for the sake of Jesus,

   ^42and they did not for a single day stop teaching and preaching in the
   Temple and in private houses the good news of Jesus, the Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1In those days, as the number of the disciples was increasing,
   complaints were made by the Greek-speaking Jews against the native Jews
   that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of
   food.

   ^2So the Twelve called in the whole body of disciples and said to them,

   "It is not desirable that we should give up preaching the word of God
   to keep accounts.

   ^3You, brothers, must pick out from your number seven men of good
   standing, who are wise and full of the Spirit, and we will put them in
   charge of this matter,

   ^4while we devote ourselves to prayer and to delivering the message."

   ^5This plan met the approval of the whole body, and they selected
   Stephen, a man full of faith and of the holy Spirit, with Philip,
   Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, who had
   been a convert to Judaism.

   ^6They brought these men before the apostles, and they prayed and laid
   their hands upon them.

   ^7So God's message continued to spread; the number of the disciples in
   Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a great many priests accepted the
   faith.

   ^8Stephen, greatly strengthened by God's favor, did remarkable signs
   and wonders among the people.

   ^9But members of the synagogue known as that of the Libyans, Cyreneans,
   and Alexandrians, and men from Cilicia and Asia undertook to debate
   with Stephen,

   ^10but they could not meet his wisdom and the inspiration with which he
   spoke.

   ^11So they instigated people to say,

   "We have heard him use abusive language about Moses and about God."

   ^12They aroused the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they set
   upon him and seized him, and brought him before the council.

   ^13Then they brought forward false witnesses, who said,

   "This man is constantly saying things against this holy place and
   against the Law,

   ^14for we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will tear this
   place down and change the customs that have been handed down to us by
   Moses."

   ^15Everyone who sat in the council fixed his eyes on him, and they saw
   that his face was like that of an angel.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1The high priest said,

   "Is this statement true?"

   ^2He answered,

   "Brothers and fathers, listen. The glorious God appeared to our
   forefather Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in
   Haran,

   ^3and he said to him, Leave your country and your relatives and come to
   the country that I will show you.'

   ^4So he left the country of the Chaldeans and went to live in Haran,
   and from there after the death of his father, God caused him to move
   into this country where you now live.

   ^5He gave him no property in it, not a single foot, but he promised to
   give it to him and his posterity after him permanently, though he had
   no children at that time.

   ^6This was what God said: His descendants will be strangers, living in
   a foreign land, and they will be enslaved and misused for four hundred
   years,

   ^7and I will sentence the nation that has enslaved them,' God said, and
   afterward they will leave that country and worship me on this spot.'

   ^8And he made the agreement of circumcision with him, and so Abraham
   became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and
   Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.

   ^9The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into slavery in
   Egypt. But God was with him,

   ^10and rescued him from all his troubles, and enabled him to win favor
   and to show wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he
   appointed him governor of Egypt and of his whole household.

   ^11Then a famine spread all over Egypt and Canaan, and there was great
   suffering, and our forefathers could not find any food.

   ^12But Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt, and he sent our
   forefathers on their first visit there.

   ^13On their second visit, Joseph made himself known to his brothers,
   and Pharaoh learned of Joseph's parentage.

   ^14Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives,
   seventy-five in all,

   ^15and Jacob came down to Egypt. There he and our forefathers died,

   ^16and they were carried back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that
   Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in
   Shechem.

   ^17As the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise God had made
   to Abraham, the people became more and more numerous in Egypt,

   ^18until another king, who knew nothing about Joseph, became ruler of
   Egypt.

   ^19He took advantage of our people and oppressed our forefathers,
   making them abandon their infant children, so that they should not
   live.

   ^20It was at this time that Moses was born. He was a wonderfully
   beautiful child, and for three months he was taken care of in his
   father's house.

   ^21When he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh adopted him and
   brought him up as her own son.

   ^22So Moses was educated in all the Egyptian culture; he was strong in
   speech and action.

   ^23When he was forty years old, it occurred to him to visit his
   brothers, the descendants of Israel.

   ^24Seeing one of them being imposed upon, he interfered and defended
   the man who was being ill treated, striking down the Egyptian.

   ^25He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was using
   him as the means of delivering them, but they did not.

   ^26The next day, he came across two of them fighting and tried to
   pacify them. He said to them, You are brothers. Why should you injure
   each other?'

   ^27But the aggressor thrust him off, saying, Who made you our ruler and
   judge?

   ^28Do you mean to kill me as you did that Egyptian yesterday?'

   ^29At those words Moses fled, and went and lived for a time in Midian,
   and two sons were born to him there.

   ^30When forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the desert
   of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.

   ^31When Moses saw it he wondered at the sight, and when he went up to
   see what it was, the voice of the Lord said,

   ^32I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob.' Moses was terrified and did not dare to look at it.

   ^33Then the Lord said to him, Take off your shoes, for the place where
   you are standing is holy ground.

   ^34I have seen all the oppression of my people in Egypt, and I have
   heard their groans, and I have come down to save them. So come! I will
   make you my messenger to Egypt!'

   ^35The Moses whom they had refused, saying to him, Who made you our
   ruler and judge?' God sent both to rule and to deliver them, with the
   help of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush.

   ^36It was he who brought them out of Egypt, and did wonders and signs
   there, and at the Red Sea, and for forty years in the desert.

   ^37This was the Moses who said to the descendants of Israel, God will
   make a prophet rise from among your brothers to teach you, just as he
   made me rise.'

   ^38It was he who with the congregation in the desert went between the
   angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and our forefathers, and received
   and communicated to you utterances that still live.

   ^39Yet our forefathers would not listen to him, but thrust him off, and
   their hearts turned back to Egypt,

   ^40for they said to Aaron, Make us gods to march in front of us, for as
   for this Moses, who brought us out of Egypt, we do not know what has
   become of him!'

   ^41They even made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to their
   idol, and held a celebration over what their own hands had made.

   ^42So God turned his back on them and left them to worship the starry
   host, just as the Book of the Prophets says,

   " Was it victims and sacrifices that you offered to me, O house of
   Israel,

   Those forty years in the desert?

   ^43You offered me the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rompha,

   The images you had made to worship!

   So I will deport you beyond Babylon.'

   ^44In the desert our forefathers had the Tent of the Testimony built
   like the model Moses had seen, just as he who spoke to him told him to
   make it.

   ^45This tent was handed down to our forefathers and they brought it
   here with them when under Joshua they dispossessed the nations that God
   drove out before them, and it existed until the time of David.

   ^46He won the approval of God and begged to be allowed to provide a
   dwelling for the God of Jacob,

   ^47and Solomon actually built a house for him.

   ^48But the Most High does not live in buildings made by human hands. As
   the prophet says,

   ^49" The sky is my throne,

   And the earth a footstool for my feet.

   What house can you build for me? says the Lord,

   Or what place is there where I can rest?

   ^50Was it not my hand that made it all?'

   ^51You stubborn people, with heathen hearts and ears, you are always
   opposing the holy Spirit, just as your forefathers did!

   ^52Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? They
   killed the men who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, whom you
   have now betrayed and killed--

   ^53you who had the Law given to you by angels, and did not obey it!"

   ^54When they heard that, they were enraged and ground their teeth at
   him.

   ^55But he, full of the holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw God's
   glory and Jesus standing at God's right hand.

   ^56And he said,

   "Look! I can see heaven open, and the Son of Man standing at God's
   right hand!"

   ^57But they uttered a great shout and stopped their ears, and they
   rushed upon him all together,

   ^58and dragged him out of the city and stoned him, the witnesses
   throwing down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.

   ^59As they stoned Stephen, he prayed,

   "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"

   ^60Then falling on his knees, he cried out,

   "Lord, do not lay this sin up against them!"

   With these words he fell asleep.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1And Saul entirely approved of his being put to death.

   A great persecution of the church in Jerusalem broke out that day, and
   they were all scattered over Judea and Samaria except the apostles.

   ^2Some pious men buried Stephen and loudly lamented him.

   ^3But Saul harassed the church. He went into one house after another,
   and dragging out men and women, put them in prison.

   ^4Those who were scattered went from place to place preaching the good
   news of the message.

   ^5Philip reached the city of Samaria, and proclaimed the Christ to
   them.

   ^6When the people heard Philip and saw the signs that he showed they
   were all interested in what he had to say,

   ^7for with loud cries foul spirits came out of many who had been
   possessed by them, and many paralytics and lame people were cured.

   ^8So there was great rejoicing in that city.

   ^9There was a man named Simon in the town, who had been amazing the
   Samaritan people by practicing magic there, and who made great
   pretensions.

   ^10Everyone there, high and low, made much of him, and said,

   "He must be what is known as the Great Power of God!"

   ^11They made much of him because for a long time he had amazed them
   with his magic.

   ^12But when they believed Philip's message of the good news of the
   Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, men and women alike
   accepted baptism.

   ^13Even Simon himself believed and after his baptism devoted himself to
   Philip, and he was amazed at seeing such signs and great wonders taking
   place.

   ^14When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted God's
   message, they sent Peter and John there.

   ^15When they came, they prayed that the Samaritans might receive the
   holy Spirit,

   ^16for it had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been
   baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

   ^17Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the holy
   Spirit.

   ^18But when Simon saw that the holy Spirit was imparted through the
   laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,

   ^19saying,

   "Give me also this power to communicate the holy Spirit to anyone I
   place my hands upon."

   ^20But Peter said to him,

   "Go to destruction with your money, for thinking you could buy God's
   gift with it!

   ^21You have no share or part in this movement, for your heart is not
   honest in the sight of God.

   ^22So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, to see
   if you may not be forgiven for thinking of such a thing.

   ^23For I see that you are a bitter poison and a bundle of iniquity!"

   ^24Simon answered,

   "You must pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things you have
   said may happen to me!"

   ^25After they had given their testimony and delivered the Lord's
   message, they went back to Jerusalem, telling the good news in many
   Samaritan villages on the way.

   ^26But an angel of the Lord said to Philip,

   "Get up and go south, by the road that runs from Jerusalem to Gaza."
   (The town is now deserted.)

   ^27So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a member
   of the court of Candace, queen of Ethiopia, her chief treasurer, who
   had come up to Jerusalem to worship,

   ^28and was on his way home. He was sitting in his car, reading the
   prophet Isaiah.

   ^29Then the Spirit said to Philip,

   "Go up and stay by that car."

   ^30Philip ran up and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and he said
   to him,

   "Do you understand what you are reading?"

   ^31"Why, how can I," he answered, "unless someone explains it to me?"
   And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him.

   ^32This was the passage of Scripture that he was reading:

   "Like a sheep he was led away to be slaughtered,

   And just as a lamb is dumb before its shearer,

   He does not open his mouth.

   ^33His sentence ended in his humiliation.

   Who will tell the story of his posterity?

   For his life is perished from the earth."

   ^34"Tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking?" said the eunuch to
   Philip, "Of himself, or of someone else?"

   ^35Then Philip began, and starting from this passage, he told him the
   good news about Jesus.

   ^36As they went on along the road, they came to some water, and the
   eunuch said,

   "Here is some water! What is there to prevent my being baptized?"

   ^38So he ordered the car to stop, and Philip and the eunuch went down
   into the water, and Philip baptized him.

   ^39When they came out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord hurried
   Philip away, and the eunuch saw nothing more of him. Full of joy, he
   went on with his journey,

   ^40while Philip found himself at Ashdod and went on telling the good
   news in all the towns all the way to Caesarea.

  Chapter 9

   ^1Now Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the Lord's
   disciples, went to the high priest,

   ^2and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if
   he found any men or women there who belonged to the Way, he might bring
   them in chains to Jerusalem.

   ^3But on his journey, as he was approaching Damascus, a sudden light
   flashed around him from heaven,

   ^4and he fell to the ground. Then he heard a voice saying to him,

   "Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?"

   ^5"Who are you, sir?" he asked.

   "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," said the voice.

   ^6"But get up and go into the city, and there you will be told what you
   ought to do."

   ^7Saul's fellow-travelers stood speechless, for they heard the voice
   but could not see anyone.

   ^8When he got up from the ground and opened his eyes he could see
   nothing. They had to take him by the hand and lead him into Damascus,

   ^9and for three days he could not see, and neither ate nor drank.

   ^10There was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, and the Lord said to
   him in a vision,

   "Ananias!"

   And he answered,

   "Yes, Lord!"

   ^11The Lord said to him,

   "Get up and go to the street called the Straight Street, and ask at the
   house of Judas for a man named Saul, from Tarsus, for he is there
   praying.

   ^12He has had a vision and seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his
   hands on him, to restore his sight."

   ^13But Ananias answered,

   "Lord, I have heard many people tell of this man, and the harm he has
   done to your people in Jerusalem.

   ^14He is here with authority to arrest everyone who calls upon your
   name."

   ^15The Lord said to him,

   "Go! This man is the means I have chosen for carrying my name among the
   heathen and their kings, and among the descendants of Israel.

   ^16For I am going to show him what he will have to endure for my sake."

   ^17Ananias set out and went to the house, and there he laid his hands
   upon Saul, and said to him,

   "Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord Jesus, who appeared to
   you on your journey, so that you may regain your sight and be filled
   with the holy Spirit."

   ^18Something like scales immediately dropped from his eyes, and his
   sight was restored, and he got up and was baptized,

   ^19and, after taking some food, regained his strength.

   Saul stayed for some time with the disciples at Damascus,

   ^20and began at once to declare in the synagogues that Jesus was the
   Son of God.

   ^21Everyone was astonished, and said,

   "Is not he the man who made such havoc of the people in Jerusalem who
   call upon that name, and who came here especially for the purpose of
   arresting such persons and taking them before the high priests?"

   ^22But Saul grew more and more powerful, and bewildered the Jews who
   lived in Damascus by his proofs that Jesus was the Christ.

   ^23After some time had passed, the Jews made a plot to kill him,

   ^24but Saul found out about the plot. They watched the city gates day
   and night, in order to kill him,

   ^25but his disciples took him one night and let him down over the wall,
   lowering him in a basket.

   ^26When he reached Jerusalem he tried to join the disciples, and they
   were all afraid of him, for they could not believe that he was really a
   disciple.

   ^27But Barnabas got hold of him and introduced him to the apostles, and
   he told them how on his journey he had seen the Lord, and that he had
   spoken to him, and how boldly he had spoken for the cause of Jesus at
   Damascus.

   ^28After that, he associated with them freely in Jerusalem,

   ^29and spoke boldly for the Lord's cause, talking and debating with the
   Greek-speaking Jews. But they tried to kill him.

   ^30When the brothers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea,
   and sent him away to Tarsus.

   ^31So the church all over Judea, Galilee, and Samaria was at peace and
   became established. It lived in reverence for the Lord and, stimulated
   by the holy Spirit, it grew steadily in numbers.

   ^32As Peter was traveling about among them all, he happened to visit
   God's people at Lydda.

   ^33There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been
   bedridden for eight years.

   ^34Peter said to him,

   "Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you! Get up, and make your bed!"

   And he got up immediately.

   ^35And everybody who lived in Lydda or in Sharon saw him, and they
   turned to the Lord.

   ^36Among the disciples at Joppa there was a woman named Tabitha, which
   is in Greek Dorcas, that is, gazelle. She had devoted herself to doing
   good and to acts of charity.

   ^37Just at that time it happened that she had been taken ill and had
   died, and they had washed her body and laid her out in a room upstairs.

   ^38As Joppa was near Lydda, the disciples heard that Peter was there,
   and they sent two men to him, urging him to come over without delay.

   ^39Peter went with them at once. When he arrived, they took him up to
   the room and all the widows stood around him crying and showing him the
   shirts and coats that Dorcas had made when she was still with them.

   ^40But Peter put them all out of the room. Then he knelt down and
   prayed, and then turning to the body he said,

   "Tabitha, stand up!"

   She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.

   ^41He gave her his hand and raised her to her feet, and calling in the
   believers and the widows, he gave her back to them alive.

   ^42This became known all over Joppa, and many came to believe in the
   Lord.

   ^43So it came about that Peter stayed for some time in Joppa, at the
   house of a tanner named Simon.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1There was at Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a captain in what was
   known as the Italian regiment.

   ^2He was a devout man, who feared God, as did all the members of his
   household. He was liberal in charities to the people, and always prayed
   to God.

   ^3One afternoon, about three o'clock, he had a vision, and distinctly
   saw an angel of God come into his room and say to him,

   "Cornelius!"

   ^4He stared at him in terror, and said,

   "What is it, sir?"

   "Your prayers and charities," the angel answered, "have gone up and
   been remembered before God.

   ^5Now send men to Joppa, for a man named Simon, who is also called
   Peter.

   ^6He is being entertained at the house of a tanner named Simon, which
   is close to the sea."

   ^7When the angel who had spoken to him was gone, Cornelius called two
   of his servants, and a devout soldier who was one of his personal
   attendants,

   ^8and after telling them the whole story, sent them to Joppa.

   ^9The next day, while they were still on their way, and were just
   getting near the town, Peter went up on the housetop about noon to
   pray.

   ^10He got very hungry, and wanted something to eat. While they were
   getting it ready, he fell into a trance,

   ^11and saw the sky opened and a thing like a great sheet coming down,
   lowered to the ground by the four corners,

   ^12with all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and wild birds in it.

   ^13And a voice came to him,

   "Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it!"

   ^14But Peter said,

   "Never, sir! For I have never eaten anything that was not ceremonially
   cleansed."

   ^15The voice came to him again a second time,

   "Do not call what God has cleansed unclean."

   ^16This happened three times; then the thing was taken right up into
   the sky.

   ^17While Peter was still wondering what the vision he had had could
   mean, the men whom Cornelius had sent had asked the way to Simon's
   house and reached the door,

   ^18and they called out to ask if Simon who was called Peter was staying
   there.

   ^19As Peter was pondering over his vision, the Spirit said to him,

   "There are two men looking for you.

   ^20Get up and go down, and go with them without any hesitation, for I
   have sent them."

   ^21Then Peter went down to see the men, and said to them,

   "I am the man you are asking for. What is the reason for your coming?"

   ^22They answered,

   "Cornelius, who is a captain, and an upright and God-fearing man, and
   who has a good reputation with the whole Jewish nation, was directed by
   a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to
   what you have to say."

   ^23So Peter invited them in and entertained them. The next day he
   started off with them, accompanied by some of the brothers from Joppa,

   ^24and the day after, he reached Caesarea. Cornelius had invited in his
   relatives and his intimate friends and was waiting for them.

   ^25When Peter actually came in, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet
   and made obeisance to him.

   ^26But Peter lifted him to his feet, and said,

   "Get up! I am only human myself."

   ^27So they went in talking together, and Peter found that many people
   had gathered,

   ^28and he said to them,

   "You know that it is against the Law for a Jew to associate with a
   foreigner or to visit one; but God has taught me not to call anyone
   vulgar or unclean.

   ^29That was why, when I was sent for, I came without any hesitation.
   And now I want to ask why you sent for me."

   ^30Cornelius answered,

   "Three days ago, just at this time of day, I was praying in my house
   about three o'clock, when a man in dazzling clothing stood before me,

   ^31and said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charities
   have been recalled to mind by God.

   ^32So send to Joppa and invite Simon who is called Peter to come here.
   He is staying at the house of a tanner named Simon, close to the sea.'

   ^33So I sent for you immediately, and you have very kindly come. Now we
   are all here in God's presence, to hear everything that the Lord has
   instructed you to say."

   ^34Then Peter began and said,

   "Now I really understand that God shows no partiality,

   ^35but welcomes the man of any nation who reveres him and does what is
   right.

   ^36He has sent his message to Israel's descendants, and made the good
   news of peace known to them through Jesus Christ. He is Lord of us all.

   ^37You know the story that has gone all over Judea, starting from
   Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed,

   ^38about Jesus of Nazareth, and how God endowed him with the power of
   the holy Spirit, and he went about doing good and curing all who were
   in the power of the devil, because God was with him.

   ^39We are witnesses of everything that he did in the country of the
   Jews and in Jerusalem. Yet they put him upon a cross and killed him.

   ^40But God raised him to life on the third day and caused him to be
   plainly seen,

   ^41not by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had designated
   beforehand, that is, by us, who ate and drank with him after he had
   risen from the dead.

   ^42He also directed us to announce to the people and bear solemn
   testimony that he is the one whom God has appointed to be the judge of
   the living and the dead.

   ^43It is of him that all the prophets bear witness that everyone that
   believes in him will have his sins forgiven in his name."

   ^44Before Peter had finished saying these words, the holy Spirit fell
   on all who were listening to his message.

   ^45The Jewish believers who had come with Peter were amazed because the
   gift of the holy Spirit had been showered upon the heathen too,

   ^46for they heard them speaking in foreign languages and declaring the
   greatness of God. Then Peter said,

   ^47"Can anyone refuse the use of water to baptize these people when
   they have received the holy Spirit just as we did?"

   ^48And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus
   Christ. Then they asked him to stay on there a few days.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1The apostles and brothers all over Judea heard that the heathen had
   also accepted God's message,

   ^2and when Peter returned to Jerusalem, the advocates of circumcision
   took him to task,

   ^3charging him with having visited and eaten with men who were not
   Jews.

   ^4Then Peter explained the matter to them from beginning to end. He
   said,

   ^5"I was praying in the town of Joppa, and while in a trance I had a
   vision. Something like a great sheet came down out of the sky, lowered
   by its four corners. It came right down to me,

   ^6and when I looked at it, I saw in it quadrupeds, wild animals,
   reptiles, and wild birds.

   ^7And I heard a voice say to me, Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat
   it!'

   ^8But I said, Never, sir! For nothing that was not ceremonially
   cleansed has ever passed my lips.'

   ^9Then the voice from heaven answered again, Do not call what God has
   cleansed unclean!'

   ^10This happened three times; then it was all drawn back again into the
   sky.

   ^11Just at that moment three men, who had been sent from Caesarea to
   find me, reached the house where we were staying,

   ^12and the Spirit told me not to hesitate to go with them. These six
   brothers here also went with me, and we went to the man's house.

   ^13Then he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and
   say, Send to Joppa for a man named Simon who is also called Peter,

   ^14and he will tell you things that will save you and your whole
   household.'

   ^15When I began to speak to them, the holy Spirit fell upon them just
   as it did upon us at the beginning,

   ^16and I remembered the saying of the Lord, John baptized in water, but
   you will be baptized in the holy Spirit.'

   ^17So if God had given them the same gift that we received when we
   believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, to be able to interfere
   with God?"

   ^18When they heard this, they made no further objection, but they gave
   honor to God, and said,

   "Then God has given even the heathen repentance and the hope of life!"

   ^19The fugitives from the persecution that had broken out over Stephen
   went all the way to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, but they told the
   message to none but Jews.

   ^20There were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene among them, however, who
   when they reached Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, and told them the
   good news about the Lord Jesus.

   ^21The Lord's hand was with them, and there were a great many who
   believed and turned to the Lord.

   ^22The news about them came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and
   they sent Barnabas all the way to Antioch.

   ^23When he reached there and saw the favor God had shown them, he was
   delighted, and encouraged them all to be resolute and steadfast in
   their devotion to the Lord,

   ^24for he was an excellent man, full of the holy Spirit and faith. So a
   considerable number of people came over to the Lord.

   ^25Then Barnabas went over to Tarsus to seek out Saul,

   ^26and found him and brought him to Antioch. The result was that for a
   whole year they met with the church, and taught large numbers of
   people, and it was at Antioch that the disciples first came to be known
   as Christians.

   ^27About that time some prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch,

   ^28and one of them named Agabus got up and under the influence of the
   Spirit revealed the fact that there was going to be a great famine all
   over the world. This was the famine that occurred in the reign of
   Claudius.

   ^29The disciples determined to make up a contribution, each according
   to his ability, and send it to the brothers who lived in Judea,

   ^30and this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1About that time King Herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged
   to the church.

   ^2He had John's brother, James, beheaded,

   ^3and when he saw that this gratified the Jews, he proceeded to arrest
   Peter too, at the time of the festival of Unleavened Bread.

   ^4He had him seized and put in jail, with four squads of soldiers to
   guard him, meaning after the Passover to bring him out before the
   people.

   ^5So Peter was kept in the jail, but the church was praying earnestly
   to God for him.

   ^6The night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was asleep
   between two soldiers, and fastened with two chains, and watchmen were
   at the door, guarding the jail,

   ^7when an angel of the Lord stood at his side, and a light shone in the
   room, and striking Peter on the side, he woke him, and said to him,
   "Get up quickly!"

   The chains dropped from his hands,

   ^8and the angel said to him,

   "Put on your belt and your sandals!"

   And he did so. Then he said to him,

   "Put on your coat and follow me!"

   ^9So he followed him out without knowing that what the angel was doing
   was real, for he thought he was having a vision.

   ^10They passed the first guard and then the second, and came to the
   iron gate that led into the city. It opened to them of itself, and they
   passed out and went along one street, when suddenly the angel left him.

   ^11Then Peter came to himself, and he said,

   "Now I am certain that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from the
   power of Herod and all that the Jewish people were expecting."

   ^12When he realized his situation, he went to the house of Mary, the
   mother of John who was also called Mark, where a number of people were
   gathered, praying.

   ^13When he knocked at the outer door, a maid named Rhoda came to answer
   it,

   ^14and when she recognized Peter's voice, in her joy she did not stop
   to open the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing
   outside.

   ^15But they said to her,

   "You are crazy!"

   But she insisted that it was so. Then they said,

   "Then it is his guardian angel!"

   ^16But Peter kept on knocking. And when they opened the door and saw
   him they were amazed.

   ^17He motioned to them to be quiet, and then related to them how the
   Lord had brought him out of the prison.

   "Tell all this to James and the brothers," he said.

   Then he left them and went somewhere else.

   ^18But when morning came, there was no little commotion among the
   soldiers as to what could have become of Peter.

   ^19Herod had inquiries made for him, and when he could not find him, he
   examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death. Then he left
   Judea for Caesarea, and stayed there.

   ^20Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came
   before him in a body, and after winning over Blastus, the king's
   chamberlain, they asked for a reconciliation, because their country
   depended upon the king's dominions for its food supply.

   ^21So a day was fixed and on it Herod, dressed in his robes of state,
   took his seat on his throne in the theater, and made them an address,

   ^22and the people shouted in applause,

   "It is a god's voice, not a man's!"

   ^23But the angel of the Lord struck him down immediately, because he
   did not give the honor to God; and he was eaten by worms and died.

   ^24But the Lord's message continued to grow and spread.

   ^25When Barnabas and Saul had performed their mission to Jerusalem,
   they went back, taking John who was called Mark with them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   ^1There were at Antioch in the church there a number of prophets and
   teachers--Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian,
   Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the governor, and Saul.

   ^2As they were engaged in worshiping the Lord and in fasting, the holy
   Spirit said,

   "Set Barnabas and Saul apart for me, for the work to which I have
   called them."

   ^3So after fasting and prayer, they laid their hands upon them and let
   them go.

   ^4Being sent out in this way by the holy Spirit, they went down to
   Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.

   ^5When they reached Salamis, they proclaimed God's message in the
   Jewish synagogues. They had John with them as their assistant.

   ^6They went through the whole island as far as Paphos, and there they
   came across a Jewish magician and false prophet named Barjesus.

   ^7He was attached to the governor, Sergius Paulus, who was an
   intelligent man. He sent for Barnabas and Saul and asked them to let
   him hear God's message.

   ^8But Elymas the magician--for that is the meaning of his name--opposed
   them, and tried to keep the governor from accepting the faith.

   ^9But Saul, who was also called Paul, was filled with the holy Spirit,
   and looked at him

   ^10and said,

   "You monster of underhandedness and cunning! You son of the devil! You
   enemy of all that is right! Will you never stop trying to make the
   Lord's straight paths crooked?

   ^11The Lord's hand is right upon you, and you will be blind and unable
   even to see the sun for a time."

   Instantly a mist of darkness fell upon him, and he groped about for
   someone to lead him by the hand.

   ^12Then the governor, seeing what had happened, believed, and was
   thunderstruck at the Lord's teaching.

   ^13Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and went to Perga in
   Pamphylia. There John left them and returned to Jerusalem,

   ^14but they went on from Perga and reached Antioch in Pisidia. On the
   Sabbath they went to the synagogue there and took seats.

   ^15After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue
   authorities sent to them, saying,

   "Brothers, if you have any appeal to make to the people, proceed."

   ^16Then Paul got up, and motioning with his hand, said,

   "Men of Israel, and you who reverence God, listen!

   ^17The God of this people of Israel chose our forefathers, and made the
   people great during their stay in Egypt, and then with uplifted hand
   led them out of Egypt.

   ^18Then after he had taken care of them for forty years in the desert,

   ^19he destroyed seven nations in Canaan, and settled them upon their
   land for about four hundred and fifty years.

   ^20After that he gave them judges, down to the time of the prophet
   Samuel.

   ^21Then they demanded a king and for forty years God gave them Saul,
   the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin.

   ^22Then he removed him and raised David up to be their king, bearing
   this testimony to him: I have found in David the son of Jesse a man
   after my own heart, who will do all that I desire.'

   ^23It is from his descendants that God has brought to Israel as he
   promised to do, a savior in Jesus,

   ^24in preparation for whose coming John had preached to all the people
   of Israel baptism in token of repentance.

   ^25Toward the end of his career, John said, What do you suppose that I
   am? I am not he! No! Someone is coming after me, the shoes on whose
   feet I am not fit to untie!'

   ^26Brothers! Descendants of the house of Abraham, and those others
   among you who reverence God! It is to us that this message of salvation
   has been sent.

   ^27For the people of Jerusalem and their leaders refused to recognize
   him, and condemned him, thus fulfilling the very utterances of the
   prophets which are read every Sabbath,

   ^28and though they could find no ground for putting him to death, they
   demanded of Pilate that he be executed.

   ^29When they had carried out everything that had been said about him in
   the Scriptures, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a
   tomb.

   ^30But God raised him from the dead,

   ^31and for many days he appeared to those who had come up to Jerusalem
   with him from Galilee, and they are now witnesses for him to the
   people.

   ^32So we now bring you the good news

   ^33that God has fulfilled to us, their children, the promise that he
   made to our forefathers, by raising Jesus to life, just as the
   Scripture says in the second psalm, You are my Son! Today I have become
   your Father!'

   ^34Now as evidence that he has raised him from the dead, never again to
   return to decay, he said this: I will fulfil to you my sacred promises
   to David.'

   ^35For in another psalm he says, You will not let your Holy One undergo
   decay.'

   ^36Now David, after serving God's purposes in his own generation, fell
   asleep and was laid among his forefathers and did undergo decay,

   ^37but he whom God raised to life did not undergo it.

   ^38You must understand therefore, my brothers, that through him the
   forgiveness of your sins is announced to you,

   ^39and that through union with him everyone who believes is cleared of
   every charge of which the Law of Moses could not clear you.

   ^40Take care, therefore, that what is said in the prophets does not
   prove true of you:

   ^41" Look, you scoffers! Then wonder and begone!

   For I am doing something in your times

   Which you will never believe even when it is related to you!' "

   ^42As they were going out, the people begged to have all this said to
   them again on the following Sabbath,

   ^43and after the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and the
   devout converts to Judaism went away with Paul and Barnabas, and they
   talked with them, and urged them to rely on the favor of God.

   ^44The next Sabbath almost all the town gathered to hear God's message.

   ^45But when the Jews saw the crowd, they were very jealous, and they
   contradicted what Paul said and abused him.

   ^46Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out plainly, and said,

   "God's message had to be told to you first, but since you thrust it off
   and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we now turn to the
   heathen.

   ^47For these are the orders the Lord has given us:

   " I have made you a light for the heathen,

   To be the means of salvation to the very ends of the earth!' "

   ^48When the heathen heard this they were delighted, and praised God's
   message, and all who were destined for eternal life believed,

   ^49and the Lord's message spread all over the country.

   ^50But the Jews stirred up the well-to-do religious women and the
   leading men of the town, and they started a persecution against Paul
   and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.

   ^51They shook off the dust from their feet in protest, and went to
   Iconium.

   ^52But the disciples continued to be full of joy and of the holy
   Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   ^1At Iconium in the same way, they went to the Jewish synagogue and
   spoke with such power that a great number of both Jews and Greeks
   believed.

   ^2But the Jews who refused their message stirred up the heathen and
   poisoned their minds against the brothers.

   ^3They spent some time there, speaking fearlessly and relying upon the
   Lord, who bore witness to his gracious message by letting signs and
   wonders be done by them.

   ^4But the people of the town were divided, some siding with the Jews
   and some with the apostles.

   ^5And when there was a movement on the part of both the heathen and the
   Jews with the authorities to insult and stone them,

   ^6and they became aware of it, they made their escape to the Lycaonian
   towns of Lystra and Derbe and the country around,

   ^7and there they went on preaching the good news.

   ^8In the streets of Lystra a man used to sit who had not the use of his
   feet. He had been lame from his birth, and had never been able to walk.

   ^9He was listening to Paul as he talked, when Paul looked at him and,
   seeing that he had faith that he would be cured,

   ^10said to him loudly,

   "Stand on your feet!"

   And he sprang up and began to walk.

   ^11The crowds, seeing what Paul had done, shouted in the Lycaonian
   language,

   "The gods have come down to us in human form!"

   ^12They called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul, because he was the principal
   speaker, Hermes.

   ^13The priest of the temple of Zeus that stood at the entrance to the
   town came with crowds of people to the gates, bringing bulls and
   garlands, meaning to offer sacrifice to them.

   ^14But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rushed
   into the crowd, tearing their clothes

   ^15and shouting,

   "Friends, why are you doing this? We are only human beings like you,
   and we bring you the good news that you should turn from these follies
   to a living God, who made heaven and earth and sea and all that they
   contain.

   ^16In ages past he let all the heathen follow their own ways;

   ^17though he did not fail to give some evidence about himself, through
   his kindnesses to you, in sending you rain from heaven and fruitful
   seasons, giving you food and happiness to your heart's content."

   ^18Even with these words they could hardly restrain the people from
   offering sacrifice to them.

   ^19But some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and won the people
   over, and they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, thinking
   that he was dead.

   ^20But the brothers gathered about him, and he got up and re-entered
   the town. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.

   ^21They proclaimed the good news in that town and made a number of
   disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,

   ^22reassuring the disciples and encouraging them to stand by the faith
   and reminding them that we have to undergo many hardships to get into
   the Kingdom of God.

   ^23They appointed elders for them in each church, and with prayer and
   fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

   ^24Then they crossed Pisidia and entered Pamphylia.

   ^25They told their message in Perga, then went on to Attalia,

   ^26and from there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had first
   been commended to God's favor for the work which they had now finished.

   ^27When they arrived there, they called the church together, and
   reported how God had worked with them, and how he had opened the way to
   faith for the heathen.

   ^28There they stayed for a long time with the disciples.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   ^1Some people came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers that
   unless they were circumcised as Moses prescribed, they could not be
   saved.

   ^2This created a disturbance and a serious discussion between Paul and
   Barnabas and them, and it was agreed that Paul and Barnabas and some
   others of their number should go up to Jerusalem to confer with the
   apostles and elders about this question.

   ^3The church saw them off upon their journey, and as they traveled
   through Phoenicia and Samaria they told of the conversion of the
   heathen, and caused great rejoicing among all the brothers.

   ^4When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the
   apostles, and the elders, and they reported how God had worked with
   them.

   ^5But some members of the Pharisees' party who had become believers got
   up and said that such converts ought to be circumcised and told to obey
   the Law of Moses.

   ^6The apostles and elders had a meeting to look into this matter.

   ^7After a long discussion, Peter got up and said to them,

   "Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose that of you all I
   should be the one from whose lips the heathen should hear the message
   of the good news and believe it.

   ^8And God who knows men's hearts testified for them by giving them the
   holy Spirit just as he had done to us,

   ^9making no difference between us and them, but cleansing their hearts
   by faith.

   ^10Then why do you now try to test God, by putting on the necks of
   these disciples a yoke that neither our forefathers nor we have been
   able to bear?

   ^11Why, we believe that it is by the mercy of the Lord Jesus that we
   are saved just as they are."

   ^12This quieted the whole meeting, and they listened while Barnabas and
   Paul told of the signs and wonders which God had done among the heathen
   through them.

   ^13When they finished James made this response:

   "Brothers, listen to me.

   ^14Symeon has told how God first showed an interest in taking from
   among the heathen a people to bear his name.

   ^15And this agrees with the predictions of the prophets which say,

   ^16" Afterward I will return, and rebuild David's fallen dwelling.

   I will rebuild its very ruins, and set it up again,

   ^17So that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,

   And all the heathen who are called by my name,

   Says the Lord,

   ^18who has been making this known from of old.'

   ^19In my opinion, therefore, we ought not to put obstacles in the way
   of those of the heathen who are turning to God,

   ^20but we should write to them to avoid anything that has been
   contaminated by idols, immorality, the meat of strangled animals, and
   the tasting of blood.

   ^21For Moses for generations past has had his preachers in every town,
   and has been read aloud in the synagogues every Sabbath."

   ^22Then the apostles and elders with the whole church resolved to
   select representatives and send them with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch.
   They were Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, both leading men
   among the brothers.

   ^23They were the bearers of this letter: "The apostles and the brothers
   who are elders send greeting to the brothers of heathen birth in
   Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.

   ^24As we have heard that some of our number, without any instructions
   from us, have disturbed you by their teaching and unsettled your minds,

   ^25we have unanimously resolved to select representatives and send them
   to you with our dear brothers Barnabas and Paul,

   ^26who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   ^27So we send Judas and Silas to you, to give you this same message by
   word of mouth.

   ^28For the holy Spirit and we have decided not to lay upon you any
   burden but this indispensable one,

   ^29that you avoid whatever has been sacrificed to idols, the tasting of
   blood and of the meat of animals that have been strangled, and
   immorality. Keep yourselves free from these things and you will get on
   well. Goodbye."

   ^30So the delegates went down to Antioch and gathered the congregation
   together and delivered the letter;

   ^31and when they read it they were delighted with the encouragement it
   gave them.

   ^32Judas and Silas were themselves prophets, and gave the brothers much
   encouragement and strength by their words.

   ^33After they had stayed some time, the brothers let them go, with a
   greeting to those who had sent them.

   ^35But Paul and Barnabas stayed on in Antioch and taught, and with many
   others preached the good news of the Lord's message.

   ^36Some time after, Paul said to Barnabas,

   "Come, let us go back and revisit the brothers in each of the towns
   where we made the Lord's message known, to see how they are doing."

   ^37Now Barnabas wanted to take John who was called Mark with them.

   ^38But Paul did not approve of taking with them a man who had deserted
   them in Pamphylia instead of going on with them to their work.

   ^39They differed so sharply about it that they separated, and Barnabas
   took Mark and sailed for Cyprus.

   ^40But Paul selected Silas and set out, the brothers commending him to
   the Lord's favor.

   ^41He traveled through Syria and Cilicia and strengthened the churches.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   ^1He went to Derbe and Lystra also. At Lystra there was a disciple
   named Timothy whose mother was a Jewish Christian while his father was
   a Greek,

   ^2and who was highly thought of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.

   ^3Paul wished to take this man on with him, and so on account of the
   Jews in that district he had him circumcised, for they all knew that
   his father was a Greek.

   ^4As they traveled on from one town to another, they passed on to the
   brothers for their observance the decisions that had been reached by
   the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.

   ^5So the churches became stronger and stronger in the faith, and their
   numbers increased from day to day.

   ^6Thus they crossed Phrygia and Galatia. The holy Spirit prevented them
   from delivering the message in Asia,

   ^7and when they reached Mysia they tried to get into Bithynia, but the
   Spirit of Jesus would not permit it,

   ^8and they passed Mysia and came down to Troas.

   ^9There Paul had a vision one night; a Macedonian was standing
   appealing to him and saying,

   "Come over to Macedonia and help us."

   ^10As soon as he had this vision, we made efforts to get on to
   Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to tell them the good
   news.

   ^11So we sailed from Troas, and ran a straight course to Samothrace,
   and next day to Neapolis.

   ^12From there we went to Philippi, a Roman garrison town, and the
   principal place in that part of Macedonia.

   In this town we stayed for some days.

   ^13On the Sabbath we went outside the gates, to the bank of the river
   where we supposed there was a praying place, and we sat down and talked
   with the women who gathered there.

   ^14One of our hearers was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple
   goods, from the town of Thyatira. She was a believer in God, and the
   Lord touched her heart, and led her to accept Paul's teaching.

   ^15When she and her household were baptized, she appealed to us, and
   said,

   "If you are really convinced that I am a believer in the Lord, come and
   stay at my house." And she insisted upon our coming.

   ^16Once as we were on our way to the praying place a slave-girl met us
   who had the gift of ventriloquism, and made her masters a great deal of
   money by her fortune-telling.

   ^17This girl would follow Paul and the rest of us, crying out,

   "These men are slaves of the Most High God, and they are making known
   to you a way of salvation."

   ^18She did this for a number of days, until Paul, very much annoyed,
   turned and said to the spirit in her,

   "In the name of Jesus Christ I order you to come out of her!" And it
   came out instantly.

   ^19But when her masters saw that their hopes of profits were gone, they
   seized Paul and Silas, dragged them to the public square, to the
   authorities,

   ^20and brought them before the chief magistrates.

   "These men," they said, "are Jews, and they are making a great
   disturbance in our town.

   ^21They are advocating practices which it is against the law for us as
   Romans to adopt or observe."

   ^22The crowd also joined in the attack on them, and the magistrates had
   them stripped and beaten.

   ^23After beating them severely, they put them in jail, and gave the
   jailer orders to keep close watch of them.

   ^24He, having had such strict orders, put them into the inner cell, and
   fastened their feet in the stocks.

   ^25But about midnight, as Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns
   of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,

   ^26suddenly there was such an earthquake that the jail shook to its
   foundations; all the doors flew open, and everybody's chains were
   unfastened.

   ^27It woke up the jailer, and when he saw that the doors of the jail
   were open, he drew his sword and was just going to kill himself,
   supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

   ^28But Paul shouted out,

   "Do not do yourself any harm! We are all here!"

   ^29Then he called for lights and rushed in, and fell trembling at the
   feet of Paul and Silas.

   ^30He led them out of the jail and said to them,

   "Gentlemen, what must I do to be saved?"

   ^31"Believe in the Lord Jesus," they said, "and you and your household
   will be saved!"

   ^32Then they told God's message to him and to all the members of his
   household.

   ^33And right then in the night, he took them and washed their wounds,
   and he and all his household were baptized immediately.

   ^34Then he took them up to his house and offered them food, and he and
   all his household were very happy over their new faith in God.

   ^35In the morning the magistrates sent policemen with instructions to
   let the men go.

   ^36The jailer reported this message to Paul, saying,

   "The magistrates have sent orders that you are to be released. So you
   can take your leave and go unmolested."

   ^37But Paul said to them,

   "They had us beaten in public without giving us a trial, and put us in
   jail, although we are Roman citizens! And now are they going to dismiss
   us secretly? By no means! Have them come here themselves and take us
   out!"

   ^38The policemen delivered this message to the magistrates, and they
   were alarmed when they heard that they were Roman citizens,

   ^39and came and conciliated them, and took them out of the jail, and
   begged them to leave the town.

   ^40After leaving the jail they went to Lydia's house, and saw the
   brothers and encouraged them. Then they left the town.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   ^1After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they reached
   Thessalonica, where the Jews had a synagogue.

   ^2Paul went to it as he was accustomed to do, and for three Sabbaths he
   discussed the Scriptures with them,

   ^3explaining them and showing that the Christ had to suffer and rise
   from the dead.

   "Jesus," he said, "of whom I am telling you, is the Christ!"

   ^4He convinced some of them, and they joined Paul and Silas, along with
   a great many devout Greeks and a number of the principal women.

   ^5This offended the Jews and they gathered some unprincipled loafers,
   formed a mob and started a riot in the town. They attacked Jason's
   house, to find them and bring them out among the people.

   ^6As they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the
   brothers before the town magistrates, shouting,

   "The men who have made trouble all over the world have come here too,

   ^7and Jason has taken them in. They all disobey the emperor's decrees,
   and claim that someone else called Jesus is king."

   ^8The crowd and the magistrates were very much excited at hearing this,

   ^9and they put Jason and the others under bonds before they let them
   go.

   ^10The brothers sent Paul and Silas away immediately, in the course of
   the following night, to Berea. On arriving there they went to the
   Jewish synagogue.

   ^11The Jews there were more high-minded than those at Thessalonica, and
   received the message with great eagerness and studied the Scriptures
   every day, to find out whether it was true.

   ^12Many of them became believers and so did no small number of Greek
   women of position, and men too.

   ^13But when the Jews at Thessalonica found out that God's message had
   been delivered at Berea by Paul, they came there too, to excite and
   stir up the populace.

   ^14Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off to the coast, while
   Silas and Timothy stayed behind.

   ^15The men who went with Paul took him all the way to Athens, and came
   back with instructions for Silas and Timothy to rejoin him as soon as
   possible.

   ^16While Paul waited for them at Athens, he was exasperated to see how
   idolatrous the city was.

   ^17He had discussions at the synagogue with the Jews and those who
   worshiped with them, and every day in the public square with any whom
   he happened to find.

   ^18Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers debated with him. Some
   of them said,

   "What is this rag-picker trying to make out?"

   Others said,

   "He seems to be preaching some foreign deities."

   This was because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the
   resurrection.

   ^19So they took him and brought him to the council of the Areopagus and
   said,

   "May we know just what this new teaching of yours is?

   ^20Some of the things you tell us sound strange to us, and we want to
   know just what they mean."

   ^21For all Athenians and all visitors there from abroad used to spend
   all their time telling or listening to something new.

   ^22Then Paul stood up in the middle of the council and said,

   "Men of Athens, from every point of view I see that you are extremely
   religious.

   ^23For as I was going about and looking at the things you worship, I
   even found an altar with this inscription: To an Unknown God.' So it is
   what you already worship in ignorance that I am now telling you of.

   ^24God who created the world and all that is in it, since he is Lord of
   heaven and earth, does not live in temples built by human hands,

   ^25nor is he waited on by human hands as though he were in need of
   anything, for he himself gives all men life and breath and everything.

   ^26From one forefather he has created every nation of mankind, and made
   them live all over the face of the earth, fixing their appointed times
   and the limits of their lands,

   ^27so that they might search for God, and perhaps grope for him and
   find him, though he is never far from any of us.

   ^28For it is through union with him that we live and move and exist, as
   some of your poets have said,

   " For we are also his offspring.'

   ^29So if we are God's children we ought not to imagine that the divine
   nature is like gold or silver or stone, wrought by human art and
   thought.

   ^30While God overlooked those times of ignorance, he now calls upon all
   men everywhere to repent,

   ^31since he has fixed a day on which he will justly judge the world
   through a man whom he has appointed, and whom he has guaranteed to all
   men by raising him from the dead."

   ^32When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some of them
   sneered, but others said,

   "We should like to hear you again on this subject."

   ^33So Paul left the council.

   ^34Some persons joined him, however, and became believers, among them
   Dionysius, a member of the council, and a woman named Damaris, and some
   others.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 18

   ^1After this he left Athens and went to Corinth.

   ^2There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had
   recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had
   ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,

   ^3and as they practiced the same trade, he stayed with them, and they
   worked together, for they were tent-makers.

   ^4Every Sabbath he would preach in the synagogue, and try to convince
   both Jews and Greeks.

   ^5By the time Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was
   absorbed in preaching the message, emphatically assuring the Jews that
   Jesus was the Christ.

   ^6But as they contradicted and abused him, he shook his clothes in
   protest, and said to them,

   "Your blood be on your own heads! I am not to blame for it! After this
   I will go to the heathen."

   ^7So he moved to the house of a devout proselyte named Titius Justus,
   which was next door to the synagogue.

   ^8But Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, and
   so did all his household, and many of the people of Corinth heard Paul
   and believed and were baptized.

   ^9One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision,

   "Do not be afraid! Go on speaking and do not give up,

   ^10for I am with you, and no one shall attack you or injure you, for I
   have many people in this city."

   ^11So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught them God's
   message.

   ^12While Gallio was governor of Greece the Jews made a concerted attack
   upon Paul, and brought him before the governor.

   ^13"This fellow," they said, "is trying to induce people to worship God
   in ways that are against the law."

   ^14Before Paul could open his lips, Gallio said to the Jews,

   "If some misdemeanor or rascality were involved, Jews, you might
   reasonably expect me to listen to you.

   ^15But as it is only a question of words and titles and your own law,
   you must look after it yourselves. I refuse to decide such matters."

   ^16And he drove them away from the court.

   ^17Then they all seized Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and
   beat him in front of the court. But Gallio paid no attention to it.

   ^18Paul stayed some time longer, and then bade the brothers goodbye and
   sailed for Syria, with Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had his
   hair cut, because of a vow he had been under.

   ^19When they reached Ephesus he left them there. He went to the
   synagogue there and had a discussion with the Jews.

   ^20They asked him to stay longer, but he would not consent.

   ^21He bade them goodbye, saying,

   "I will come back to you again if it is God's will."

   Then he sailed from Ephesus.

   ^22When he reached Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and paid his
   respects to the church, and then went on to Antioch.

   ^23After spending some time there, he started out again, and traveled
   systematically through Galatia and Phrygia, reassuring all the
   disciples.

   ^24A Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was
   an eloquent man, skilful in the use of the Scriptures.

   ^25He had had some instruction about the Way of the Lord, and he talked
   with burning zeal and taught painstakingly about Jesus, though he knew
   of no baptism but John's.

   ^26He spoke very confidently in the synagogue at first, but when
   Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the
   Way of God to him more correctly.

   ^27As he wanted to cross to Greece, the brothers wrote to the disciples
   there, urging them to welcome him. On his arrival there he was of great
   service to those who through God's favor had become believers,

   ^28for he vigorously refuted the Jews in public, and showed from the
   scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   ^1It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul, after passing through
   the interior, reached Ephesus. Finding some disciples there,

   ^2he said to them,

   "Did you receive the holy Spirit when you became believers?"

   "No," they said to him, "we never even heard that there was a holy
   Spirit."

   ^3"How then were you baptized?" he asked.

   "With John's baptism," they answered.

   ^4"John's baptism was a baptism in token of repentance," said Paul,
   "and he told the people to believe in him who was to follow him, that
   is, in Jesus."

   ^5When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
   Jesus,

   ^6and when Paul laid his hands on them, the holy Spirit came on them,
   and they spoke in foreign tongues and with prophetic inspiration.

   ^7There were about twelve of them in all.

   ^8He went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke
   confidently, holding discussions and trying to persuade them about the
   Kingdom of God.

   ^9But as some of them were obstinate and refused to believe, finding
   fault with the Way before the people, he left them, and withdrew the
   disciples, and held daily discussions in the lecture-room of Tyrannus.

   ^10This went on for two years, so that everyone who lived in Asia,
   Greeks as well as Jews, heard the Lord's message.

   ^11God did such extraordinary wonders by means of Paul,

   ^12that people took to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons he had used,
   and they were cured of their diseases, and the evil spirits went out of
   them.

   ^13Some Jews who went from place to place casting out demons tried to
   use the name of the Lord Jesus in the cases of people who had evil
   spirits in them, saying,

   "I command you in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches!"

   ^14A Jewish high priest named Sceva had seven sons who were doing this.

   ^15But the evil spirit answered,

   "I know Jesus, and I know of Paul, but who are you?"

   ^16And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang at them, and
   overpowered them all, with such violence that they ran out of the house
   tattered and bruised.

   ^17This came to be known to everyone who lived in Ephesus, Greeks as
   well as Jews, and great awe came over them all, and the name of the
   Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor.

   ^18Many who became believers would come and openly confess their former
   practices.

   ^19A number of people who had practiced magic brought out their books
   and burned them publicly. The value of these was estimated and found to
   be ten thousand dollars.

   ^20So the Lord's message went on growing wonderfully in influence and
   power.

   ^21After these events, Paul, under the Spirit's guidance, resolved to
   go to Jerusalem, and to revisit Macedonia and Greece on the way.

   "After I have gone there," he said, "I must see Rome also."

   ^22He sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia,
   while he stayed on for a while in Asia.

   ^23Just at that time a great commotion arose about the Way.

   ^24A silversmith named Demetrius was making large profits for his
   workmen by the manufacture of silver shrines of Artemis.

   ^25He got the workmen in that and similar trades together, and said to
   them,

   "Men, you know that this business is the source of our prosperity,

   ^26and you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but almost all over
   Asia, this man Paul has persuaded and drawn away numbers of people,
   telling them that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.

   ^27There is danger, therefore, not only that this business of ours will
   be discredited, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis
   will be neglected and the magnificence of her whom all Asia and the
   world worship will be a thing of the past!"

   ^28When they heard this, they became very angry, and cried,

   "Great Artemis of Ephesus!"

   ^29So the commotion spread all over the city, and by a common impulse
   the people rushed to the theater, dragging with them two Macedonians,
   Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions.

   ^30Paul wanted to go before the people himself, but the disciples would
   not allow it.

   ^31Some of the religious authorities also, who were friends of his,
   sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.

   ^32Meanwhile the people were shouting, some one thing and some another,
   for the meeting was in confusion, and most of them had no idea why they
   had come together.

   ^33Some of the crowd called upon Alexander, as the Jews had pushed him
   to the front, and he made a gesture with his hand and was going to
   speak in defense of them to the people.

   ^34But when they saw that he was a Jew, a great shout went up from them
   all, and they cried for two hours,

   "Great Artemis of Ephesus!"

   ^35At last the recorder quieted the mob and said,

   "Men of Ephesus, who in the world does not know that the city of
   Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis, and of the
   image that fell down from the sky?

   ^36So as these facts are undeniable, you must be calm, and not do
   anything reckless.

   ^37For you have brought these men here, though they have not been
   guilty of disloyalty nor uttered any blasphemy against our goddess.

   ^38If Demetrius and his fellow-craftsmen have a charge to bring against
   anyone, there are the courts and the governors; let them take legal
   action.

   ^39But if you require anything beyond that, it must be settled before
   the regular assembly.

   ^40For we are in danger of being charged with rioting in connection
   with today's events, though there is really nothing about this
   commotion that we will not be able to explain."

   ^41With these words he dismissed the assembly.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 20

   ^1When the confusion was over, Paul sent for the disciples and
   encouraged them. Then he bade them goodbye and started for Macedonia.

   ^2After traveling through those districts and giving the people a great
   deal of encouragement, he went on to Greece

   ^3where he stayed for three months. Just as he was going to sail for
   Syria, the Jews made a plot against him, and he made up his mind to
   return by way of Macedonia.

   ^4He was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus,
   Aristarchus and Secundus, from Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy,
   and Tychicus and Trophimus, from Asia.

   ^5They went on to Troas and waited for us there,

   ^6while we sailed from Philippi after the festival of Unleavened Bread,
   and joined them at Troas five days later. There we stayed a week.

   ^7On the first day of the week, when we had met for the breaking of
   bread, Paul addressed them, as he was going away the next morning, and
   he prolonged his address until midnight.

   ^8There were a great many lamps in the upstairs room where we met

   ^9and a young man named Eutychus, who was sitting at the window, became
   very drowsy as Paul's address grew longer and longer, and finally went
   fast asleep and fell from the third story to the ground, and was picked
   up for dead.

   ^10But Paul went downstairs, and threw himself upon him, and put his
   arms around him.

   "Do not be alarmed," he said, "he is still alive."

   ^11Then he went upstairs again, and broke the bread, and ate, and after
   a long talk with them that lasted until daylight, he went away.

   ^12They took the boy home alive, and were greatly comforted.

   ^13We had already gone on board the ship and sailed for Assos,
   intending to take Paul on board there, for that was the arrangement he
   had made, as he intended to travel there by land.

   ^14So when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went on to
   Mitylene.

   ^15Sailing from there, we arrived off Chios on the following day. On
   the next we crossed to Samos, and on the next we reached Miletus.

   ^16For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have
   to lose any time in Asia, for he was hurrying to reach Jerusalem, if
   possible, by the day of the Harvest Festival.

   ^17From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.

   ^18When they came, he said to them,

   "You know well enough how I lived among you all the time from the first
   day I set foot in Asia,

   ^19and how I served the Lord most humbly and with tears, through all
   the trials that I encountered because of the plots of the Jews.

   ^20I never shrank from telling you anything that was for your good, nor
   from teaching you in public or at your houses,

   ^21but earnestly urged Greeks as well as Jews to turn to God in
   repentance and to believe in our Lord Jesus.

   ^22I am here now on my way to Jerusalem, for the Spirit compels me to
   go there, though I do not know what will happen to me there,

   ^23except that in every town I visit, the holy Spirit warns me that
   imprisonment and persecution are awaiting me.

   ^24But my life does not matter, if I can only finish my race and do the
   service intrusted to me by the Lord Jesus, of declaring the good news
   of God's favor.

   ^25Now I know perfectly well that none of you among whom I went about
   preaching the Kingdom of God will ever see my face again.

   ^26Therefore I declare to you today that I am not responsible for the
   blood of any of you,

   ^27for I have not shrunk from letting you know God's purpose without
   reserve.

   ^28Take care of yourselves and of the whole flock, of which the holy
   Spirit has made you guardians, and be shepherds of the church of God,
   which he got at the cost of his own life.

   ^29I know that after I am gone savage wolves will get in among you and
   will not spare the flock,

   ^30and from your own number men will appear and teach perversions of
   the truth in order to draw the disciples away after them.

   ^31So you must be on your guard and remember that for three years,
   night and day, I never stopped warning any of you, even with tears.

   ^32Now I commit you to the Lord, and to the message of his favor, which
   will build you up and give you a place among those whom God has
   consecrated.

   ^33I have never coveted anyone's gold or silver or clothes.

   ^34You know well enough that these hands of mine provided for my needs
   and my companions.

   ^35I showed you in every way that by hard work like that we must help
   those who are weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, for he
   said, It makes one happier to give than to be given to.' "

   ^36With these words, he knelt down with them all and prayed.

   ^37They all wept aloud, and throwing their arms about Paul's neck they
   kissed him affectionately,

   ^38for they were especially saddened at his saying that they would
   never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 21

   ^1When the parting was over and we had sailed, we made a straight run
   to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara.

   ^2There we found a ship bound for Phoenicia, and we went on board and
   sailed on it.

   ^3After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on our left, we sailed for
   Syria, and put in at Tyre, for the ship was to unload her cargo there.

   ^4So we looked up the disciples there and stayed a week with them.
   Instructed by the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in
   Jerusalem.

   ^5But when our time was up, we left there and went on, and all of them
   with their wives and children escorted us out of the town. There we
   knelt down on the beach and prayed;

   ^6then we bade one another goodbye, and we went on board the ship, and
   they went home.

   ^7After making the run from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, where we
   greeted the brothers and spent a day with them.

   ^8The next day we left there and went on to Caesarea, where we went to
   the house of Philip the missionary, who was one of the Seven, and
   stayed with him.

   ^9He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.

   ^10We spent a number of days there, and in the course of them a prophet
   named Agabus came down from Judea.

   ^11He came to see us and took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and
   hands with it, and said,

   "This is what the holy Spirit says: The Jews at Jerusalem will bind the
   man who owns this belt like this, and will hand him over to the
   heathen!' "

   ^12When we heard this, we and the people there all begged him not to go
   up to Jerusalem.

   ^13Then Paul answered,

   "What do you mean by crying and breaking my heart? I am ready not only
   to be bound at Jerusalem but to die there for the sake of the Lord
   Jesus."

   ^14So as he would not yield, we gave up urging him, and said,

   "The Lord's will be done!"

   ^15After this we made our preparations and started for Jerusalem.

   ^16Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and took us to the
   house of Mnason, a man from Cyprus, one of the early disciples, to
   spend the night.

   ^17When we reached Jerusalem, the brothers there gave us a hearty
   welcome.

   ^18On the next day we went with Paul to see James, and all the elders
   came in.

   ^19Paul greeted them warmly and gave a detailed account of what God had
   done among the heathen through his efforts.

   ^20They praised God when they heard it, and they said to him,

   "You see, brother, how many thousand believers there are among the
   Jews, all of them zealous upholders of the Law.

   ^21They have been told that you teach all Jews who live among the
   heathen to turn away from Moses, and that you tell them not to
   circumcise their children nor to observe the old customs.

   ^22What then? They will be sure to hear that you have come.

   ^23So do what we tell you. We have four men here who are under a vow.

   ^24Join them, undergo the rites of purification with them, and pay
   their expenses so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody
   will understand that there is no truth in the stories about you, but
   that you yourself observe the Law.

   ^25As for the heathen who have become believers, we have written them
   our decision that they must avoid anything that has been contaminated
   by idols, the tasting of blood, the meat of strangled animals, and
   immorality."

   ^26Then Paul joined the men and went through the rites of purification
   with them and the next day went to the Temple to give notice of the
   time when, upon the offering of the sacrifice for each one of them,
   their days of purification would be over.

   ^27The seven days were almost over when the Jews from Asia caught sight
   of him in the Temple, and stirred up all the crowd and seized him,

   ^28shouting,

   "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere
   against our people and the Law and this place, and besides he has
   actually brought Greeks into the Temple and desecrated this sacred
   place."

   ^29For they had previously seen Trophimus of Ephesus with him in the
   city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the Temple.

   ^30The whole city was thrown into confusion, and the people hurried
   together, and seized Paul and dragged him outside of the Temple, the
   gates of which were immediately shut.

   ^31They were trying to kill him when the news reached the colonel of
   the regiment that all Jerusalem was in a tumult.

   ^32He immediately got some officers and men and hurried down among
   them, and when they saw the colonel and the soldiers they stopped
   beating Paul.

   ^33Then the colonel came up and seized him, and ordered him to be bound
   with two chains, and then inquired who he was and what he had been
   doing.

   ^34Some of the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and as he
   could not find out the facts on account of the confusion, he ordered
   him to be taken into the barracks.

   ^35When Paul got to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers,
   on account of the violence of the mob,

   ^36for the mass of people followed them shouting,

   "Kill him!"

   ^37Just as they were going to take him into the barracks, Paul said to
   the colonel,

   "May I say something to you?"

   "Do you know Greek?" the colonel asked.

   ^38"Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago raised the four thousand
   cut-throats and led them out into the desert?"

   ^39"I am a Jew," Paul answered, "from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of
   no insignificant city. I beg you to let me speak to the people."

   ^40He gave him permission, and Paul standing on the steps made a
   gesture to the people, and when they had become quiet he spoke to them
   in Hebrew.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 22

   ^1"Brothers and fathers," he said, "listen to what I have to say in my
   defense."

   ^2When they heard him speak to them in Hebrew, they became even more
   quiet, and he said,

   ^3"I am a Jew, and I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but was brought up
   here in this city, and thoroughly educated under the teaching of
   Gamaliel in the Law of our forefathers. I was zealous for God, just as
   all of you are today.

   ^4I persecuted this Way even to the death, and bound both men and women
   and put them in prison,

   ^5as the high priest and the whole council will bear me witness. In
   fact, they gave me letters to the brothers in Damascus and I went there
   to bind those who were there and bring them back to Jerusalem to be
   punished.

   ^6But on my way, as I was approaching Damascus, suddenly about noon, a
   blaze of light flashed around me from heaven,

   ^7and I fell upon the ground and heard a voice say to me, Saul! Saul!
   Why do you persecute me?'

   ^8I answered, Who are you, sir?' I am Jesus of Nazareth,' he said, whom
   you are persecuting.'

   ^9The men who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the
   voice of the one who was speaking to me.

   ^10Then I said, What am I to do, sir?' The Lord said to me, Get up and
   go into Damascus. There you will be told of all you are destined to
   do.'

   ^11As I could not see, because of the dazzling light, my companions had
   to lead me by the hand, and so I reached Damascus.

   ^12There a man named Ananias, a devout observer of the Law, highly
   respected by all the Jews who lived there,

   ^13came to see me, and standing by my side, said to me, Saul, my
   brother, regain your sight!' Then instantly I regained my sight and
   looked at him,

   ^14and he said, The God of our forefathers has appointed you to learn
   his will and to see his Righteous One and hear him speak,

   ^15for you shall be his witness before all men of what you have seen
   and heard.

   ^16And now, why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash out your
   sins, calling on his name.'

   ^17After I had returned to Jerusalem, one day when I was praying in the
   Temple, I fell into a trance,

   ^18and saw him saying to me, Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once,
   for they will not accept your evidence about me.'

   ^19And I said, Lord, they know that I used to go through one synagogue
   after another, and to imprison and flog those who believed in you,

   ^20and when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I stood
   by and approved it, and took charge of the clothes of the men who
   killed him.'

   ^21But he said to me, Go! I will send you far away to the heathen.' "

   ^22They had listened to him until he said that, but then they shouted,

   "Kill him and get him out of the world! A creature like that ought not
   to be allowed to live!"

   ^23As they were shouting and throwing their clothes about and flinging
   dust into the air,

   ^24the colonel ordered Paul brought into the barracks, and gave
   directions that he should be examined under the lash, so that he might
   find out why they made such an outcry against him.

   ^25But when they had strapped him up, Paul said to the officer who was
   standing near,

   "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen, and without giving him a
   trial?"

   ^26Upon hearing this, the officer went to the colonel and reported it.

   "What do you propose to do?" he said. "This man is a Roman citizen."

   ^27Then the colonel came to Paul and said,

   "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?"

   "Yes," he said.

   ^28"I had to pay a large sum for my citizenship," said the colonel.

   "But I am a citizen by birth," said Paul.

   ^29Then the men who had been going to examine him immediately left him,
   and the colonel himself was alarmed to find that Paul was a Roman
   citizen and that he had had him bound.

   ^30The next day, as he wished to find out the real reason why the Jews
   denounced him, he had him unbound and ordered the high priests and the
   whole council to assemble, and took Paul down and brought him before
   them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 23

   ^1Paul looked steadily at the council and said,

   "Brothers, I have done my duty to God with a perfectly clear conscience
   up to this very day."

   ^2At this the high priest Ananias ordered the people who were standing
   nearest to him to strike him on the mouth.

   ^3Then Paul said to him,

   "God will strike you, you white-washed wall! Do you sit there to try me
   by the Law, and order them to strike me in violation of the Law?"

   ^4But the people who stood near him said,

   "Do you mean to insult God's high priest?"

   ^5"I did not know, brothers," said Paul, "that he was high priest, for
   the Scripture says, You shall not say anything against any ruler of
   your people.' "

   ^6Knowing that part of them were Sadducees and part of them Pharisees,
   Paul called out in the council,

   "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, and the son of Pharisees! It is for my hope
   for the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial!"

   ^7When he said that, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the
   Sadducees, and the meeting was divided.

   ^8For the Sadducees hold that there is no resurrection and that there
   are no angels or spirits, while the Pharisees believe in all three.

   ^9So there was a great uproar, and some scribes of the Pharisees' party
   got up and insisted,

   "We find nothing wrong with this man. Suppose some spirit or angel
   really spoke to him!"

   ^10As the dispute was becoming violent, the colonel began to be afraid
   that they would tear Paul in pieces, and ordered the soldiers to go
   down and get him away from them and bring him into the barracks.

   ^11On the following night the Lord stood beside him and said,

   "Courage! For just as you have testified for me in Jerusalem, you must
   testify in Rome also."

   ^12In the morning, the Jews made a conspiracy and took an oath not to
   eat or drink till they had killed Paul.

   ^13There were more than forty of them involved in this plot,

   ^14and they went to the high priests and elders and said to them,

   "We have taken a solemn oath not to touch anything to eat till we have
   killed Paul.

   ^15Now you and the council must suggest to the colonel that he should
   have Paul brought down to you, as you mean to look into his case more
   carefully, and we will be ready to kill him before he gets down."

   ^16But Paul's nephew heard of the plot, and he came and got into the
   barracks, and told Paul.

   ^17Paul called one of the officers and said to him,

   "Take this young man to the colonel, for he has something to tell him."

   ^18So he took him to the colonel, and said,

   "The prisoner Paul called me to him and asked me to bring this young
   man to you, as he has something to say to you."

   ^19So the colonel took him by the arm and stepping aside where they
   could be alone, asked,

   "What is it that you have to tell me?"

   ^20"The Jews," he answered, "have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down
   to the council tomorrow, on the ground that you mean to have a fuller
   inquiry made into his case.

   ^21But do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are
   lying in wait for him, and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink
   till they have killed him. They are all ready now, and are only waiting
   to get your promise."

   ^22So the colonel sent the youth away, directing him not to tell anyone
   that he had given him this information.

   ^23Then he called in two of his officers and said to them,

   "Get two hundred men ready to march to Caesarea, with seventy mounted
   men and two hundred spear-men, by nine o'clock tonight."

   ^24They were also to provide horses for Paul to ride, so that they
   might take him in safety to Felix, the governor,

   ^25to whom he wrote a letter to this effect:

   ^26"Claudius Lysias sends greetings to his Excellency Felix, the
   governor.

   ^27This man had been seized by the Jews and they were just going to
   kill him when I came upon them with my men and rescued him, as I had
   learned that he was a Roman citizen.

   ^28As I wanted to learn what charge they made against him, I had him
   brought before their council,

   ^29and found that their accusations had to do with questions about
   their Law, but that he was not charged with anything that would call
   for his death or imprisonment.

   ^30As I have been informed that a plot against him is brewing, I am
   sending him on to you at once, and directing his accusers to present
   their charges against him before you."

   ^31Then the soldiers took Paul, as they had been ordered to do, and
   escorted him as far as Antipatris that night.

   ^32The next day, they returned to the barracks, leaving the mounted men
   to go on with him,

   ^33and they on reaching Caesarea delivered the letter to the governor
   and handed Paul over to him.

   ^34After reading the letter, he asked Paul what province he belonged
   to, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,

   ^35he said,

   "I will hear your case as soon as your accusers arrive."

   And he gave orders that he should be kept in Herod's palace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 24

   ^1Five days later, the high priest Ananias came down with some of the
   elders and an attorney named Tertullus, and they presented their case
   against Paul before the governor.

   ^2When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began the prosecution.

   "Your Excellency Felix," he said, "since through your efforts we enjoy
   perfect peace, and through your foresight this nation is securing
   needed reforms,

   ^3we always and everywhere acknowledge this with profound gratitude.

   ^4But--not to detain you too long--I beg you to be kind enough to give
   us a brief hearing.

   ^5For we have found this man a pest and a disturber of the peace among
   Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect,

   ^6and actually tried to desecrate the Temple, but we caught him.

   ^8If you will examine him yourself you will be able to find out from
   him all about the things we charge him with."

   ^9The Jews also joined in these charges, and said that the statement
   was true.

   ^10The governor made a sign to Paul to speak, and he answered,

   "As I know that for many years you have acted as judge for this nation,
   I cheerfully undertake my defense,

   ^11for it is not more than twelve days ago, as you can easily satisfy
   yourself, that I went up to worship at Jerusalem,

   ^12and they have never found me debating with anyone in the Temple, or
   creating a disturbance among the people in the synagogues or about the
   city,

   ^13and they cannot sustain the charges they have just made against me.

   ^14I admit that in worshiping the God of my forefathers I follow the
   way of life that they call a sect, but I believe everything that is
   taught in the Law or written in the prophets,

   ^15and I have the same hope in God that they themselves hold, that
   there is to be a resurrection of the upright and the wicked.

   ^16Therefore I strive always to have a clear conscience before God and
   men.

   ^17After an absence of several years, I had come to bring charitable
   donations for my nation, and to offer sacrifice.

   ^18I had undergone the rites of purification and was occupied with
   these matters when they found me in the Temple, with no crowd or
   disturbance at all. But there were some Jews from Asia

   ^19who ought to be here before you and to present their charges if they
   have any to make against me.

   ^20Or let these men themselves tell what they found wrong in me when I
   appeared before the council--

   ^21unless it was the one thing I shouted out as I stood among them--It
   is on the question of the resurrection of the dead that I am here on
   trial before you today!' "

   ^22Then Felix, who was somewhat well informed about the Way, adjourned
   the trial, saying to the Jews,

   "When Lysias, the colonel, comes down here, I will decide your case."

   ^23He ordered the officer to keep Paul in custody, but to allow him
   some freedom, and not to prevent his friends from looking after him.

   ^24Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish,
   and sent for Paul and heard what he had to say about faith in Christ
   Jesus.

   ^25But as he talked of uprightness, self-control, and the coming
   judgment, Felix became alarmed, and said,

   "You may go for the present. I will find time later to send for you."

   ^26At the same time he hoped to get money from Paul, and for that
   reason he used to send for him very often and talk with him.

   ^27But when two whole years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius
   Festus, and as he wanted to gratify the Jews, Felix left Paul in
   prison.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 25

   ^1Three days after his arrival in the province, Festus went up from
   Caesarea to Jerusalem,

   ^2and the high priests and Jewish leaders presented their charges
   against Paul,

   ^3and begged him as a favor to order Paul to come to Jerusalem,
   plotting to kill him on the way.

   ^4Festus answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea, and
   that he himself was going there soon.

   ^5"So have your principal men go down with me," he said, "and present
   charges against the man, if there is anything wrong with him."

   ^6After staying only eight or ten days there, he went down to Caesarea,
   and the next day took his place in the judge's chair, and ordered Paul
   brought in.

   ^7When he came, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded
   him, and made a number of serious charges against him, which they could
   not substantiate.

   ^8Paul said in his own defense,

   "I have committed no offense against the Jewish Law or the Temple or
   the emperor."

   ^9Then Festus, wishing to gratify the Jews, said to Paul,

   "Will you go up to Jerusalem and be tried there before me on these
   charges?"

   ^10But Paul said,

   "I am standing before the emperor's court, where I ought to be tried. I
   have done the Jews no wrong, as you can easily see.

   ^11If I am guilty and have done anything that deserves death, I do not
   refuse to die; but if there is no truth in the charges that these men
   make against me, no one can give me up to them; I appeal to the
   emperor."

   ^12Then Festus after conferring with the council answered,

   "You have appealed to the emperor, and to the emperor you shall go!"

   ^13Some time after, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea on a
   state visit to Festus,

   ^14and as they stayed there several days, Festus laid Paul's case
   before the king.

   "There is a man here," he said, "who was left in prison by Felix,

   ^15and when I was at Jerusalem the Jewish high priests and elders
   presented their case against him, and asked for his conviction.

   ^16I told them that it was not the Roman custom to give anybody up
   until the accused met his accusers face to face and had a chance to
   defend himself against their accusations.

   ^17So they came back here with me and the next day without losing any
   time I took my place in the judge's chair and ordered the man brought
   in.

   ^18But when his accusers got up, they did not charge him with any such
   crimes as I had expected.

   ^19Their differences with him were about their own religion and about a
   certain Jesus who had died but who Paul said was alive.

   ^20I was at a loss as to how to investigate such matters, and I asked
   him if he would like to go to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges
   there.

   ^21But Paul appealed to have his case reserved for his Majesty's
   decision, and I have ordered him kept in custody until I can send him
   to the emperor."

   ^22"I should like to hear the man myself," Agrippa said to Festus.

   "You shall hear him tomorrow," Festus answered.

   ^23So the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and went
   into the audience-room attended by officers and the leading citizens of
   the town, and at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.

   ^24Then Festus said,

   "King Agrippa and all who are present, you see here the man about whom
   the whole Jewish people have applied to me both at Jerusalem and here,
   clamoring that he ought not to live any longer.

   ^25I could not find that he had done anything for which he deserved
   death, but as he appealed to his Majesty I decided to send him to him.

   ^26Yet I have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him. So
   I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King
   Agrippa, in order to get from your examination of him something to put
   in writing.

   ^27For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner on, without stating the
   charges against him."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 26

   ^1Then Agrippa said to Paul,

   "You are at liberty to speak in your own defense."

   So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.

   ^2"I think myself fortunate, King Agrippa," said he, "that it is before
   you that I am to defend myself today against all the things the Jews
   charge me with,

   ^3especially because you are so familiar with all the Jewish customs
   and questions. I beg you, therefore, to listen to me with patience.

   ^4The way I lived from my youth up, spending my early life among my own
   nation and at Jerusalem, is well known to all Jews,

   ^5for they have known from the first, if they are willing to give
   evidence, that I was a Pharisee and my life was that of the strictest
   sect of our religion.

   ^6Even now it is for my hope in the promise that God made to our
   forefathers that I stand here on trial,

   ^7the promise in the hope of seeing which fulfilled our twelve tribes
   serve God zealously night and day. It is about this hope, your Majesty,
   that I am accused by some Jews.

   ^8Why do you all think it incredible that God should raise the dead?

   ^9I once thought it my duty vigorously to oppose the cause of Jesus of
   Nazareth.

   ^10That was what I did at Jerusalem when on the authority of the high
   priests I put many of God's people in prison. When they were put to
   death, I cast my vote against them,

   ^11and many a time in all the synagogues I had them punished, and tried
   to force them to say impious things. In my extreme rage against them I
   even pursued them to distant towns.

   ^12I was once going to Damascus on this business, authorized and
   commissioned by the high priests,

   ^13when on the road at noon, your Majesty, I saw a light from heaven
   brighter than the sun flash around me and my fellow-travelers.

   ^14We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew,
   Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me? You cannot kick against the goad!'

   ^15Who are you, sir?' said I. The Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you are
   persecuting.

   ^16But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for
   the express purpose of appointing you to serve me and to testify to
   what you have seen and to the visions you will have of me.

   ^17I will save you from your people and from the heathen, to whom I
   will send you

   ^18to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from
   Satan's control to God, so that they may have their sins forgiven and
   have a place among those who are consecrated through faith in me.'

   ^19Therefore, King Agrippa, I did not disobey that heavenly vision,

   ^20but first to the people of Damascus and Jerusalem and then all over
   Judea, and even to the heathen I preached that they must repent and
   turn to God and live as men who have repented should.

   ^21That is why the Jews seized me in the Temple and tried to kill me.

   ^22To this day I have had God's help and I stand here to testify to
   high and low alike, without adding a thing to what Moses and the
   prophets declared would happen,

   ^23if the Christ was to suffer and by being the first to rise from the
   dead was to proclaim the light to our people and to the heathen."

   ^24As he said this in his defense, Festus called out,

   "You are raving, Paul! Your great learning is driving you mad!"

   ^25"I am not raving, your Excellency Festus," said Paul, "I am telling
   the sober truth.

   ^26The king knows about this, and I can speak to him with freedom. I do
   not believe that he missed any of this, for it did not happen in a
   corner!

   ^27King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do!"

   ^28"You are in a hurry to persuade me and make a Christian of me!"
   Agrippa said to Paul.

   ^29"In a hurry or not," said Paul, "I would to God that not only you,
   but all who hear me today, might be what I am--except for these
   chains!"

   ^30Then the king rose, with the governor and Bernice and those who had
   sat with them,

   ^31and after leaving the room, in talking the matter over together,
   they said,

   "This man has not done anything to deserve death or imprisonment."

   ^32"He might have been set at liberty," said Agrippa to Festus, "if he
   had not appealed to the emperor."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 27

   ^1When it was decided that we were to sail for Italy, Paul and some
   other prisoners were turned over to an officer of the Imperial
   regiment, named Julius.

   ^2We went on board an Adramyttian ship bound for the ports of Asia, and
   put to sea. We had a Macedonian from Thessalonica, named Aristarchus,
   with us.

   ^3The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius kindly allowed Paul to go
   and see his friends and be taken care of.

   ^4Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, as the
   wind was against us,

   ^5and after traversing the Cilician and Pamphylian waters, we reached
   Myra in Lycia.

   ^6There the officer found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy, and put
   us on board her.

   ^7For a number of days we made slow progress and had some difficulty in
   arriving off Cnidus. Then as the wind kept us from going on, we sailed
   under the lee of Crete, off Cape Salmone,

   ^8and with difficulty coasted along it and reached a place called Fair
   Havens, near the town of Lasea.

   ^9As a great deal of time had now passed, and navigation had become
   dangerous, for the autumn fast was already over, Paul began to warn
   them.

   ^10"Gentlemen," he said, "I see that this voyage is likely to end in
   disaster and heavy loss, not only to ship and cargo but to our own
   lives also."

   ^11But the officer was more influenced by the pilot and the captain
   than by what Paul had to say,

   ^12and as the harbor was not fit to winter in, the majority favored
   putting to sea again, in the hope of being able to reach and winter in
   Phoenix, a harbor in Crete facing west-south-west and west-north-west.

   ^13When a moderate south wind sprang up, thinking their object was
   within reach, they weighed anchor, and ran close along the coast of
   Crete.

   ^14But very soon a violent wind which they call a Northeaster rushed
   down from it.

   ^15The ship was caught by it and could not face the wind, so we gave
   way and let her run before it.

   ^16As we passed under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we
   managed with great difficulty to secure the ship's boat.

   ^17After hoisting it on board, they used ropes to brace the ship, and
   as they were afraid of being cast on the Syrtis banks, they lowered the
   sail, and let the ship drift.

   ^18The next day, as the storm continued to be violent, they began to
   throw the cargo overboard,

   ^19and on the next, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their
   own hands.

   ^20For a number of days neither the sun nor the stars were visible, and
   the storm continued to rage, until at last we gave up all hope of being
   saved.

   ^21Then, when they had gone a long time without food, Paul got up among
   them, and said,

   "Gentlemen, you ought to have listened to me and not to have sailed
   from Crete and incurred this disaster and loss.

   ^22Even now, I beg you to keep up your courage, for there will be no
   loss of life among you, but only of the ship.

   ^23For last night an angel of the God I belong to and serve stood
   before me,

   ^24and said, Do not be afraid, Paul! You must stand before the emperor,
   and see! God has given you the lives of all the people who are on the
   ship with you.'

   ^25So keep up your courage, gentlemen! For I have faith in God that it
   will be just as I was told.

   ^26But we are to be stranded on some island."

   ^27It was the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting
   through the Adriatic when about midnight the sailors began to suspect
   that there was land ahead.

   ^28On taking soundings, they found a depth of twenty fathoms, and a
   little later, taking soundings again, they found a depth of fifteen.

   ^29Then as they were afraid we might go on the rocks, they dropped four
   anchors from the stern and waited anxiously for daylight.

   ^30The sailors wanted to escape from the ship, and actually lowered the
   boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to run out anchors
   from the bow,

   ^31but Paul said to the officers and the soldiers,

   "You cannot be saved unless these men stay on board."

   ^32Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the boat and let it drift
   away.

   ^33Until daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat.

   "For fourteen days," he said, "you have been constantly on the watch,
   without taking anything to eat.

   ^34I beg you to eat something; it is necessary for your safety. For not
   one of you will lose even a hair of his head."

   ^35With these words he took some bread and after thanking God for it
   before them all, he broke it in pieces and began to eat it.

   ^36This raised the spirits of all of them, and they took something to
   eat.

   ^37There were about seventy-six of us on board.

   ^38When they had had enough to eat, they threw the wheat into the sea,
   in order to lighten the ship.

   ^39When daylight came they could not recognize the coast, but they saw
   a bay with a beach and determined to run the ship ashore there if
   possible.

   ^40So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same
   time they undid the lashings of the steering oars, and hoisting the
   foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.

   ^41But they struck a shoal and ran the ship aground. The bow struck and
   could not be moved, while the stern began to break up under the strain.

   ^42The soldiers proposed to kill the prisoners, for fear some of them
   might swim ashore and escape,

   ^43but the officer wanted to save Paul, and so he prevented them from
   doing this, and ordered all who could swim to jump overboard first and
   get to land,

   ^44and the rest to follow on planks or other pieces of wreckage. So
   they all got safely to land.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 28

   ^1After our escape we learned that the island was called Malta.

   ^2The natives showed us remarkable kindness, for they made a fire and
   welcomed us, because of the rain that had come on and the cold.

   ^3Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, when a
   viper crawled out of them because of the heat and fastened on his hand.

   ^4When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to
   one another,

   "This man is undoubtedly a murderer, for though he has been saved from
   the sea, justice will not let him live."

   ^5But he only shook the creature off into the fire and was unharmed.

   ^6They expected to see him swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after
   waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they
   changed their minds and said that he was a god.

   ^7The governor of the island, whose name was Publius, had estates in
   that part of the island, and he welcomed us and entertained us
   hospitably for three days.

   ^8Publius' father happened to be sick in bed with fever and dysentery,
   and Paul went to see him and after praying laid his hands on him and
   cured him.

   ^9After that, the other sick people on the island came and were cured.

   ^10They made us many presents, and when we sailed, they provided us
   with everything that we needed.

   ^11Three months later, we sailed on an Alexandrian ship named the
   Dioscuri, which had wintered at the island.

   ^12We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days,

   ^13then we weighed anchor and reached Rhegium. A day later, a south
   wind sprang up and the following day we arrived at Puteoli.

   ^14There we found some of the brothers, and they urged us to spend a
   week with them. Then we went on to Rome.

   ^15The brothers there had had news of our coming, and came as far as
   Appius' Forum and Three Taverns to meet us, and when Paul saw them he
   thanked God and was greatly encouraged.

   ^16When we reached Rome, Paul was given permission to live by himself,
   with a soldier to guard him.

   ^17Three days later, he invited the leading Jews to come to see him,
   and when they came he said to them,

   "Brothers, I have done nothing against our people, or the customs of
   our forefathers, yet I was turned over to the Romans as a prisoner at
   Jerusalem.

   ^18They examined me and were ready to let me go, as I was innocent of
   any crime that deserved death.

   ^19But the Jews objected, and I was obliged to appeal to the
   emperor--not that I had any charge to make against my own nation.

   ^20That is why I asked to see you and speak with you, for it is on
   account of Israel's hope that I have to wear this chain."

   ^21"We have had no letters about you from Judea," they answered, "and
   none of the brothers who have come here has reported or said anything
   against you.

   ^22But we want to hear you state your views, for as far as this sect is
   concerned, we understand that everywhere it is denounced."

   ^23So they fixed a day, and came in even larger numbers to the place
   where he was staying, and from morning till night he explained to them
   the Kingdom of God and gave his testimony, trying to convince them
   about Jesus from the Law of Moses and the Prophets.

   ^24Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others would not
   believe.

   ^25As they could not agree among themselves, they started to leave,
   when Paul added one last word.

   "The holy Spirit put it finely," he said, "when it said to your
   forefathers through the prophet Isaiah,

   ^26" Go to this Nation and say to them,

   "You will listen, and listen, and never understand,

   And you will look, and look, and never see!

   ^27For this nation's mind has grown dull,

   And they hear faintly with their ears,

   And they have shut their eyes,

   So as never to see with their eyes,

   And hear with their ears,

   And understand with their minds, and turn back,

   And let me cure them!" '

   ^28"Understand then that this message of God's salvation has been sent
   to the heathen. They will listen to it!"

   ^30So he stayed for two full years in rented lodgings of his own, and
   welcomed everybody who came to see him,

   ^31preaching the Kingdom of God to them and teaching about the Lord
   Jesus Christ openly and unhindered.

The Letter to the Romans
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ, called as an apostle, set apart to
   declare God's good news,

   ^2which he promised long ago through his prophets in the holy
   Scriptures,

   ^3about his Son, who was physically descended from David,

   ^4and decisively declared Son of God in his holiness of spirit, by
   being raised from the dead--Jesus Christ our Lord,

   ^5through whom we have received God's favor and been commissioned in
   his name to urge obedience and faith upon all the heathen,

   ^6including you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ--

   ^7to all those in Rome whom God loves, who are called to be his people;
   God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

   ^8First I thank my God through Jesus Christ about you all, because the
   news of your faith is spreading all over the world.

   ^9As God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in spreading the good
   news of his Son, I never fail to mention you when I pray,

   ^10and to ask that somehow by God's will I may some day at last succeed
   in reaching you.

   ^11For I long to see you, to convey to you some spiritual gift that
   will strengthen you;

   ^12in other words, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by one
   another's faith.

   ^13I want you to understand, brothers, that I have often intended to
   come to see you (though thus far I have been prevented) in order to
   produce some results among you, as well as among the rest of the
   heathen.

   ^14I owe a debt both to Greeks and to foreigners, to the cultivated and
   the uncultivated.

   ^15So, for my part, I am eager to preach the good news to you at Rome
   also.

   ^16For I am not ashamed of the good news, for it is God's power for the
   salvation of everyone who has faith, of the Jew first and then of the
   Greek.

   ^17In it God's way of uprightness is disclosed through faith and for
   faith, just as the Scripture says, "The upright will have life because
   of his faith."

   ^18For God's anger is breaking forth from heaven against all the
   impiety and wickedness of the men who in their wickedness are
   suppressing the truth.

   ^19For all that can be known of God is clearly before them; God has
   shown it to them.

   ^20Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible nature--his
   eternal power and divine character--have been clearly perceptible
   through what he has made. So they have no excuse,

   ^21for, though they knew God, they have not honored him as God or given
   thanks to him, but they have indulged in futile speculations, until
   their stupid minds have become dark.

   ^22They called themselves wise, but they have turned into fools,

   ^23and for the splendor of the immortal God they have substituted
   images in the form of mortal man, birds, animals, and reptiles.

   ^24So God abandoned them, with their heart's cravings, to impurity, and
   let them degrade their own bodies.

   ^25For they had exchanged the truth of God for what was false, and
   worshiped and served what he had created, instead of the Creator, who
   is blessed forever! Amen!

   ^26That is why God has abandoned them to degrading passions. Their
   women have exchanged their natural function for one that is unnatural,

   ^27and men too in the same way have disregarded the natural function of
   women and been consumed with passion for one another, men for men,
   acting indecently, and experiencing in their own persons the inevitable
   penalty of what they have done.

   ^28And just as they refused to recognize God any longer, God has
   abandoned them to unworthy impulses and indecent conduct.

   ^29They revel in every kind of wrongdoing, wickedness, greed, and
   depravity. They are full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and
   ill-nature.

   ^30They are gossips, slanderers, abhorrent to God, insolent,
   overbearing, boastful, ingenious in evil, undutiful,

   ^31conscienceless, treacherous, unloving, and unpitying.

   ^32They know God's decree that those who act in this way deserve to
   die, yet they not only do it, but applaud any who do.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1Therefore you have no excuse, whoever you are, if you pose as a
   judge, for when you pass judgment on someone else, you are condemning
   yourself, for you, who sit in judgment, do the very same things
   yourself.

   ^2We know that God's judgment rightfully falls upon those who do such
   things as these.

   ^3And do you suppose, when you sit in judgment upon those who do such
   things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the judgment of
   God?

   ^4Do you think so lightly of his wealth of kindness, forbearance, and
   patience, and fail to see that God's kindness ought to induce you to
   repent?

   ^5But in your obstinacy and impenitence you are storing up wrath for
   yourself on the Day of Wrath, when the justice of God will burst forth.

   ^6For he will pay every man for what he has done.

   ^7Those who by persistently doing right strive for glory, honor, and
   immortality will have eternal life,

   ^8but self-seeking people who are disloyal to the truth and responsive
   only to what is wrong will experience anger and fury,

   ^9crushing distress and anguish, every human soul of them that actually
   does what is wrong--the Jew first, and the Greek also;

   ^10but there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does
   right, the Jew first, and the Greek also,

   ^11for God shows no partiality.

   ^12All who sin without having the Law will perish without regard to the
   Law, and all who sin under the Law will be judged by the Law.

   ^13For merely hearing the Law read does not make a man upright in the
   sight of God; men must obey the Law to be made upright.

   ^14When heathen who have no Law instinctively obey what the Law
   demands, even though they have no law they are a law to themselves,

   ^15for they show that what the Law demands is written on their hearts,
   and their consciences will testify for them, and with their thoughts
   they will either accuse or perhaps defend themselves,

   ^16on that Day when, as the good news I preach teaches, God through
   Christ Jesus judges what men have kept secret,

   ^17Suppose you call yourself a Jew, and rely on law, and boast about
   God,

   ^18and can understand his will, and from hearing the Law read can tell
   what is right,

   ^19and you are sure that you can guide the blind, enlighten people who
   are in the dark,

   ^20train the foolish, teach the young, since you have knowledge and
   truth formulated in the Law--

   ^21why, then, will you teach others and refuse to teach yourself? Will
   you preach against stealing, and yet steal yourself?

   ^22Will you warn men against adultery, and yet practice it yourself?
   Will you pretend to detest idols, and yet rob their temples?

   ^23Will you boast of the Law and yet dishonor God by breaking it?

   ^24For, as the Scripture says, the very name of God is abused among the
   heathen, because of you!

   ^25Circumcision will help you only if you observe the Law; but if you
   are a lawbreaker, you might as well be uncircumcised.

   ^26So if people who are uncircumcised observe the requirements of the
   Law, will they not be treated as though they were circumcised?

   ^27And if, although they are physically uncircumcised, they obey the
   Law, they will condemn you, who break the Law, although you have it in
   writing, and are circumcised.

   ^28For the real Jew is not the man who is one outwardly, and the real
   circumcision is not something physical and external.

   ^29The real Jew is the man who is one inwardly, and real circumcision
   is a matter of the heart, a spiritual, not a literal, thing. Such a man
   receives his praise not from men, but from God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1What advantage is there then in being a Jew, and what is the use of
   circumcision?

   ^2A great deal, from every point of view. In the first place, the Jews
   were intrusted with the utterances of God.

   ^3What if some of them have shown a lack of faith? Can their lack of it
   nullify the faithfulness of God?

   ^4By no means! God must prove true, though every man be false; as the
   Scripture says,

   "That you may be shown to be upright in what you say,

   And win your case when you go into court."

   ^5But if our wrongdoing brings out the uprightness of God, what are we
   to say? Is it wrong in God (I am putting it in ordinary human terms) to
   inflict punishment?

   ^6By no means, for then how could he judge the world?

   ^7But, you say, if a falsehood of mine has brought great honor to God
   by bringing out his truthfulness, why am I tried for being a sinner?

   ^8And why not say, as people abuse us for saying and charge us with
   saying, "Let us do evil that good may come out of it"? Such people will
   be condemned as they deserve!

   ^9What does this mean? Are we Jews at a disadvantage? Not at all. We
   have already charged Jews and Greeks all alike with being under the
   control of sin.

   ^10As the Scripture says,

   "There is not a single man who is upright,

   ^11No one understands, no one searches for God.

   ^12All have turned away, they are one and all worthless,

   No one does right, not a single one!

   ^13Their throats are like open graves,

   They use their tongues to deceive;

   The venom of asps is behind their lips,

   ^14And their mouths are full of bitter curses.

   ^15Their feet are swift when it comes to shedding blood,

   ^16Ruin and wretchedness mark their paths,

   ^17They do not know the way of peace.

   ^18There is no reverence for God before their eyes!"

   ^19Now we know that everything the Law says is addressed to those under
   its authority, so that every mouth may be shut, and the whole world be
   made accountable to God.

   ^20For no human being can be made upright in the sight of God by
   observing the Law. All that the Law can do is to make man conscious of
   sin.

   ^21But now God's way of uprightness has been disclosed without any
   reference to law, though the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it.

   ^22It is God's way of uprightness and comes through having faith in
   Jesus Christ, and it is for all who have faith, without distinction.

   ^23For all men sin and come short of the glory of God,

   ^24but by his mercy they are made upright for nothing, by the
   deliverance secured through Christ Jesus.

   ^25For God showed him publicly dying as a sacrifice of reconciliation
   to be taken advantage of through faith. This was to vindicate his own
   justice (for in his forbearance, God passed over men's former sins)--

   ^26to vindicate his justice at the present time, and show that he is
   upright himself, and that he makes those who have faith in Jesus
   upright also.

   ^27Then what becomes of our boasting? It is shut out. On what
   principle? What a man does? No, but whether a man has faith.

   ^28For we hold that a man is made upright by faith; the observance of
   the Law has nothing to do with it.

   ^29Does God belong to the Jews alone? Does he not belong to the heathen
   too? Of course he belongs to the heathen too;

   ^30there is but one God, and he will make the circumcised upright on
   the ground of their faith and the uncircumcised upright because of
   theirs."

   ^31Is this using faith to overthrow law? Far from it. This confirms the
   Law.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1Then what are we to say about our ancestor Abraham?

   ^2For if he was made upright by what he did, it is something to be
   proud of. But not to be proud of before God,

   ^3for what does the Scripture say? "Abraham had faith in God, and it
   was credited to him as uprightness."

   ^4Now paying a workman is not considered a favor, but an obligation,

   ^5but a man who has no work to offer, but has faith in him who can make
   the ungodly upright, has his faith credited to him as uprightness.

   ^6So David himself says of the happiness of those to whom God credits
   uprightness without any reference to their actions,

   ^7"Happy are they whose violations of the Law have been forgiven, whose
   sins are covered up!

   ^8Happy is the man whose sin the Lord will take no account of!"

   ^9Does this happiness apply to those who are circumcised, or to those
   who are uncircumcised as well? What we say is, Abraham's faith was
   credited to him as uprightness.

   ^10In what circumstances? Was it after he was circumcised or before?
   Not after he was circumcised, but before;

   ^11and he was afterward given the mark of circumcision as the stamp of
   God's acknowledgment of the uprightness based on faith that was his
   before he was circumcised, so that he should be the forefather of all
   who, without being circumcised, have faith and so are credited with
   uprightness,

   ^12and the forefather of those circumcised persons who not only share
   his circumcision but follow our forefather Abraham's example in the
   faith he had before he was circumcised.

   ^13For the promise made to Abraham and his descendants that the world
   should belong to him did not come to him or his descendants through the
   Law, but through the uprightness that resulted from his faith.

   ^14For if it is the adherents of the Law who are to possess it, faith
   is nullified and the promise amounts to nothing!

   ^15For the Law only brings down God's wrath; where there is no law,
   there is no violation of it.

   ^16That is why it all turns upon faith; it is to make it a matter of
   God's favor, so that the promise may hold good for all Abraham's
   descendants, not only those who are adherents of the Law, but also
   those who share the faith of Abraham. For he is the father of all of
   us;

   ^17as the Scripture says, "I have made you the father of many nations."
   The promise is guaranteed in the very sight of God in whom he had
   faith, who can bring the dead to life and call into being what does not
   exist.

   ^18Abraham, hoping against hope, had faith, and so became the father of
   many nations, in fulfilment of the Scripture, "So countless shall your
   descendants be."

   ^19His faith did not weaken, although he realized that his own body was
   worn out, for he was about a hundred years old, and that Sarah was past
   bearing children.

   ^20He did not incredulously question God's promise, but his faith gave
   him power and he praised God

   ^21in the full assurance that God was able to do what he had promised.

   ^22That was why it was credited to him as uprightness.

   ^23It was not on his account alone that these words, "it was credited
   to him," were written,

   ^24but also on ours, for it is to be credited also to us who have faith
   in him who raised from the dead our Lord Jesus,

   ^25who was given up to death to make up for our offenses, and raised to
   life to make us upright.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1So as we have been made upright by faith, let us live in peace with
   God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

   ^2by whom we have been introduced through faith to the favor of God
   that we now enjoy, and let us glory in our hope of sharing the glory of
   God.

   ^3More than that, we ought to glory in our troubles, for we know that
   trouble produces endurance,

   ^4and endurance, character, and character, hope,

   ^5and hope will not disappoint us. For, through the holy Spirit that
   has been given us, God's love has flooded our hearts.

   ^6For when we were still helpless, at the decisive moment Christ died
   for us godless men.

   ^7Why, a man will hardly give his life for an upright person, though
   perhaps for a really good man some may be brave enough to die.

   ^8But God proves his love for us by the fact that Christ died for us
   when we were still sinners.

   ^9So if we have already been made upright by his death, it is far more
   certain that through him we shall be saved from God's anger!

   ^10If, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through
   the death of his Son, it is far more certain that now that we are
   reconciled we shall be saved through sharing in his life!

   ^11More than that, we actually glory in God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ, to whom we owe our reconciliation.

   ^12It is just like the way in which through one man sin came into the
   world, and death followed sin, and so death spread to all men, because
   all men sinned.

   ^13It is true sin was in the world before the Law was given, and men
   are not charged with sin where there is no law.

   ^14Still death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not
   sinned as Adam had, in the face of an express command. So Adam
   foreshadowed the one who was to come.

   ^15But there is no comparison between God's gift and that offense. For
   if one man's offense made the mass of mankind die, God's mercy and his
   gift given through the favor of the one man Jesus Christ have far more
   powerfully affected mankind.

   ^16Nor is there any comparison between the gift and the effects of that
   one man's sin. That sentence arose from the act of one man, and was for
   condemnation; but God's gift arose out of many offenses and results in
   acquittal.

   ^17For if that one man's offense made death reign through that one man,
   all the more will those who receive God's overflowing mercy and his
   gift of uprightness live and reign through the one individual Jesus
   Christ.

   ^18So as one offense meant condemnation for all men, just so one
   righteous act means acquittal and life for all men.

   ^19For just as that one man's disobedience made the mass of mankind
   sinners, so this one's obedience will make the mass of them upright.

   ^20Then law slipped in, and multiplied the offense. But greatly as sin
   multiplied, God's mercy has far surpassed it,

   ^21so that just as sin had reigned through death, mercy might reign
   through uprightness and bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our
   Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1Then what shall we conclude? Are we to continue to sin to increase
   the spread of mercy?

   ^2Certainly not! When we have died to sin, how can we live in it any
   longer?

   ^3Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into union with
   Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death?

   ^4Through baptism we have been buried with him in death, so that just
   as he was raised from the dead through the Father's glory, we too may
   live a new life.

   ^5For if we have grown into union with him by undergoing a death like
   his, of course we shall do so by being raised to life like him,

   ^6for we know that our old self was crucified with him, to do away with
   our sinful body, so that we might not be enslaved to sin any longer,

   ^7for when a man is dead he is free from the claims of sin.

   ^8If we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
   him,

   ^9for we know that Christ, once raised from the dead, will never die
   again; death has no more hold on him.

   ^10For when he died, he became once for all dead to sin; the life he
   now lives is a life in relation to God.

   ^11So you also must think of yourselves as dead to sin but alive to
   God, through union with Christ Jesus.

   ^12So sin must not reign over your mortal bodies, and make you obey
   their cravings,

   ^13and you must not offer the parts of your bodies to sin as the
   instruments of wrong, but offer yourselves to God as men brought back
   from death to life, and offer the parts of your bodies to him as
   instruments of uprightness.

   ^14For sin must no longer control you, for you live not under law but
   under mercy.

   ^15What follows, then? Are we to sin, because we live not under law but
   under mercy? Certainly not!

   ^16Do you not know that when you submit to being someone's slaves, and
   obeying him, you are the slaves of the one whom you obey, whether your
   slavery is to sin, and leads to death, or is to obedience, and leads to
   uprightness?

   ^17But, thank God! though you were once slaves of sin, you have become
   obedient from your hearts to the standard of teaching that you
   received,

   ^18and so you have been freed from sin, and made slaves of uprightness.

   ^19I use these familiar human terms because of the limitations of your
   nature. For just as you before gave up the parts of your bodies in
   slavery to vice and greater and greater license, you must now give them
   up in slavery to uprightness, which leads to consecration.

   ^20For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as far as uprightness
   was concerned.

   ^21What good did you get from doing the things you are now ashamed of?
   Why, they result in death!

   ^22But now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of
   God, the benefit you get is consecration, and the final result is
   eternal life.

   ^23For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is eternal
   life through union with Christ Jesus our Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know what law
   is--that law governs a man only as long as he lives?

   ^2For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives,
   but if he dies, the marriage law no longer applies to her.

   ^3So if she marries another man while her husband is alive, she is
   called an adulteress, but if her husband dies, she is free from that
   law, and can marry someone else without being an adulteress.

   ^4So you, in turn, my brothers, in the body of Christ have become dead
   as far as the Law is concerned, so that you may belong to another
   husband, who was raised from the dead in order that we might bear fruit
   for God.

   ^5For when we were living mere physical lives the sinful passions,
   awakened by the Law, operated through the organs of our bodies to make
   us bear fruit for death.

   ^6But now the Law no longer applies to us; we have died to what once
   controlled us, so that we can now serve in the new Spirit, not under
   the old letter.

   ^7Then what shall we conclude? That the Law is sin? Certainly not! Yet,
   if it had not been for the Law, I should never have learned what sin
   was; I should not have known what it was to covet if the Law had not
   said, "You must not covet."

   ^8That command gave sin an opening, and it led me to all sorts of
   covetous ways, for sin is lifeless without law.

   ^9I was once alive and without law, but when the command came, sin
   awoke and then I died;

   ^10and the command that should have meant life in my case proved to
   mean death.

   ^11The command gave sin an opening and sin deceived me and killed me
   with it.

   ^12So the Law itself is holy, and each command is holy, just, and good.

   ^13Did what was good, then, prove the death of me? Certainly not! It
   was sin that did so, so that it might be recognized as sin, because
   even through something that was good it effected my death, so that
   through the command it might appear how immeasurably sinful sin was.

   ^14We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am physical, sold into
   slavery to sin.

   ^15I do not understand what I am doing, for I do not do what I want to
   do; I do things that I hate.

   ^16But if I do what I do not want to do, I acknowledge that the Law is
   right.

   ^17In reality, it is not I that do these things; it is sin, which has
   possession of me.

   ^18For I know that nothing good resides in me, that is, in my physical
   self; I can will, but I cannot do what is right.

   ^19I do not do the good things that I want to do; I do the wrong things
   that I do not want to do.

   ^20But if I do the things that I do not want to do, it is not I that am
   acting, it is sin, which has possession of me.

   ^21I find the law to be that I who want to do right am dogged by what
   is wrong.

   ^22My inner nature agrees with the divine law,

   ^23but all through my body I see another principle in conflict with the
   law of my reason, which makes me a prisoner to that law of sin that
   runs through my body.

   ^24What a wretched man I am! Who can save me from this doomed body?

   ^25Thank God! it is done through Jesus Christ our Lord! So mentally I
   am a slave to God's law, but physically to the law of sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1So there is no condemnation any more for those who are in union with
   Christ Jesus.

   ^2For the life-giving law of the Spirit through Christ Jesus has freed
   you from the Law of sin and death.

   ^3For though it was impossible for the Law to do it, hampered as it was
   by our physical limitations, God, by sending his own Son in our sinful
   physical form, as a sin-offering, put his condemnation upon sin through
   his physical nature,

   ^4so that the requirement of the Law might be fully met in our case,
   since we live not on the physical but on the spiritual plane.

   ^5People who are controlled by the physical think of what is physical,
   and people who are controlled by the spiritual think of what is
   spiritual.

   ^6For to be physically minded means death, but to be spiritually minded
   means life and peace.

   ^7For to be physically minded means hostility to God, for it refuses to
   obey God's law, indeed it cannot obey it.

   ^8Those who are physical cannot please God.

   ^9But you are not physical but spiritual, if God's Spirit has really
   taken possession of you; for unless a man has Christ's spirit, he does
   not belong to Christ.

   ^10But if Christ is in your hearts, though your bodies are dead in
   consequence of sin, your spirits have life in consequence of
   uprightness.

   ^11If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead has taken
   possession of you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also
   give your mortal bodies life through his Spirit that has taken
   possession of you.

   ^12So, brothers, we are under obligations, but not to the physical
   nature, to live under its control,

   ^13for if you live under the control of the physical you will die, but
   if, by means of the Spirit, you put the body's doings to death, you
   will live.

   ^14For all who are guided by God's Spirit are God's sons.

   ^15It is not a consciousness of servitude that has been imparted to
   you, to fill you with fear again, but the consciousness of adoption as
   sons, which makes us cry, "Abba!" that is, Father.

   ^16The Spirit itself testifies with our spirits that we are God's
   children,

   ^17and if children, heirs also; heirs of God, and fellow-heirs with
   Christ, if we really share his sufferings in order to share his glory
   too.

   ^18For I consider what we suffer now not to be compared with the glory
   that is to burst upon us.

   ^19For creation is waiting with eager longing for the sons of God to be
   disclosed.

   ^20For it was not the fault of creation that it was frustrated; it was
   by the will of him who condemned it to that, and in the hope

   ^21that creation itself would be set free from its bondage to decay,
   and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.

   ^22We know that all creation has been groaning in agony together until
   now.

   ^23More than that, we ourselves, though we have in the Spirit a
   foretaste of the future, groan to ourselves as we wait to be declared
   God's sons, through the redemption of our bodies.

   ^24It was in this hope that we were saved. But a hope that can be seen
   is not a hope, for who hopes for what he sees?

   ^25But when we hope for something that we do not see, we wait
   persistently for it.

   ^26In the same way the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not
   know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit itself pleads for us with
   inexpressible yearnings,

   ^27and he who searches our hearts knows what the Spirit means, for it
   pleads for God's people in accordance with his will.

   ^28We know that in everything God works with those who love him, whom
   he has called in accordance with his purpose, to bring about what is
   good.

   ^29For those whom he had marked out from the first he predestined to be
   made like his Son, so that he should be the eldest of many brothers;

   ^30and those whom he has predestined he calls, and those whom he calls
   he makes upright, and those whom he makes upright he glorifies.

   ^31Then what shall we conclude from this? If God is for us, who can be
   against us?

   ^32Will not he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us
   all, with that gift give us everything?

   ^33Who can bring any accusation against those whom God has chosen? God
   pronounces them upright;

   ^34who can condemn them? Christ Jesus who died, or rather who was
   raised from the dead, is at God's right hand, and actually pleads for
   us.

   ^35Who can separate us from Christ's love? Can trouble or misfortune or
   persecution or hunger or destitution or danger or the sword?

   ^36As the Scripture says,

   "For your sake we are being put to death all day long,

   We are treated like sheep to be slaughtered."

   ^37But in all these things we are more than victorious through him who
   loved us.

   ^38For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor their
   hierarchies nor the present nor the future

   ^39nor any supernatural forces either of height or depth will be able
   to separate us from the love God has shown in Christ Jesus our Lord!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   ^1I am telling the truth as a Christian, it is no falsehood, for my
   conscience under the holy Spirit's influence bears me witness in it,

   ^2when I say that I am greatly pained and my heart is constantly
   distressed,

   ^3for I could wish myself accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake
   of my brothers, my natural kindred.

   ^4For they are Israelites, and to them belong the rights of sonship,
   God's glorious presence, the divine agreements and legislation, the
   Temple service, the promises,

   ^5and the patriarchs, and from them physically Christ came--God who is
   over all be blessed forever! Amen.

   ^6Not that God's message has failed. For not everybody who is descended
   from Israel really belongs to Israel,

   ^7nor are they all children of Abraham because they are descended from
   him, but he was told, "The line of Isaac will be called your
   descendants."

   ^8That is to say, it is not his physical descendants who are children
   of God, but his descendants born in fulfilment of the promise who are
   considered his true posterity.

   ^9For this is what the promise said: "When I come back at this time
   next year, Sarah will have a son."

   ^10And that is not all, for there was Rebecca too, when she was about
   to bear twin sons to our forefather Isaac.

   ^11For before the children were born or had done anything either good
   or bad, in order to carry out God's purpose of selection, which depends
   not on what men do but on his calling them,

   ^12she was told, "The elder will be the younger's slave."

   ^13As the Scripture says, "I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau."

   ^14What do we conclude? That God is guilty of injustice? By no means.

   ^15He said to Moses, "I will have mercy on the man on whom I choose to
   have mercy, and take pity on the man on whom I choose to take pity."

   ^16So it depends not on human will or exertion, but on the mercy of
   God.

   ^17The Scripture says to Pharaoh, "I have raised you to your position
   for the very purpose of displaying my power in dealing with you, and
   making my name known all over the world."

   ^18So he has mercy on anyone he pleases, and hardens the heart of
   anyone he pleases.

   ^19"Why, then," you will ask, "does he still find fault? For who can
   resist his will?"

   ^20On the contrary, who are you, my friend, to answer back to God? Can
   something a man shapes say to the man who shaped it, "Why did you make
   me like this?"

   ^21Has not the potter with his clay the right to make from the same
   lump one thing for exalted uses and another for menial ones?

   ^22Then what if God, though he wanted to display his anger and show his
   power, has shown great patience toward the objects of his anger,
   already ripe for destruction,

   ^23so as to show all the wealth of his glory in dealing with the
   objects of his mercy, whom he has prepared from the beginning to share
   his glory,

   ^24including us whom he has called not only from among the Jews but
   from among the heathen?

   ^25Just as he says in Hosea,

   "I will call a people that was not mine, my people,

   And her who was not beloved, my beloved,

   ^26And in the very place where they were told, You are no people of
   mine,'

   They shall be called sons of the living God."

   ^27And Isaiah cries out about Israel, "Although the sons of Israel are
   as numerous as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be
   saved,

   ^28for the Lord will execute his sentence rigorously and swiftly on the
   earth."

   ^29As Isaiah foretold,

   "If the Lord of Hosts had not left us children,

   We would have been like Sodom, and have resembled Gomorrah!"

   ^30Then what do we conclude? That heathen who were not striving for
   uprightness attained it, that is, an uprightness which was produced by
   faith;

   ^31while Israel, straining after a law that should bring uprightness,
   did not come up to it.

   ^32And why? Because they did not seek it through faith, but through
   doing certain things. They stumbled over that stone that makes people
   stumble,

   ^33as the Scripture says,

   "See, I will put a stone on Zion to make people stumble, and a rock to
   trip over,

   But no one who has faith in it will be disappointed."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1Brothers, my heart is full of good will toward them; my prayer to God
   is that they may be saved.

   ^2I can testify to their sincere devotion to God, but it is not an
   intelligent devotion.

   ^3For in their ignorance of God's way of uprightness and in the attempt
   to set up one of their own, they refused to conform to God's way of
   uprightness.

   ^4For Christ marks the termination of law, so that now anyone who has
   faith may attain uprightness.

   ^5Moses said that anyone who carried out the uprightness the Law
   prescribed would find life through it.

   ^6But this is what the uprightness that springs from faith says: "Do
   not say to yourself, Who will go up to heaven?' " that is, to bring
   Christ down;

   ^7or " Who will go down into the depths?' " that is, to bring Christ up
   from the dead.

   ^8No! This is what it says: "God's message is close to you, on your
   lips and in your mind"--that is, the message about faith that we
   preach.

   ^9For if with your lips you acknowledge the message that Jesus is Lord,
   and with your mind you believe that God raised him from the dead, you
   will be saved.

   ^10For with their minds men believe and are made upright, and with
   their lips they make the acknowledgment and are saved.

   ^11For the Scripture says, "No one who has faith in him will be
   disappointed."

   ^12There is no distinction between Jew and Greek for they all have the
   same Lord, and he is generous to all who call upon him.

   ^13For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.

   ^14But how are they to call upon him if they have not believed in him?
   And how are they to believe him if they have never heard him? And how
   are they to hear unless someone preaches to them?

   ^15And how are men to preach unless they are sent to do it? As the
   Scripture says, "How welcome is the coming of those who bring good
   news!"

   ^16It is true, they have not all accepted the good news, for Isaiah
   says, "Lord, who has believed what we have told?"

   ^17So faith comes from hearing what is told, and that hearing comes
   through the message about Christ.

   ^18But I ask, had they no opportunity to hear it? On the contrary,

   "Their voices have gone all over the earth,

   And their words to the ends of the world."

   ^19But I ask again, did Israel fail to understand? Why, to begin with,
   Moses said,

   "I will make you jealous of what is no nation at all,

   I will exasperate you at a senseless nation."

   ^20Then Isaiah broke out boldly and said,

   "I have been found by men who were not looking for me,

   I have shown myself to men who were not asking what my will was."

   ^21But of Israel he said,

   "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate
   people."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1I ask then, has God repudiated his people? By no means. Why, I am an
   Israelite myself, I am descended from Abraham, and I belong to the
   tribe of Benjamin.

   ^2God has not repudiated his people, which he had marked out from the
   first. Do you not know what the Scripture says in speaking of Elijah,
   how he appealed to God against Israel?

   ^3"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your
   altars, I am the only one left and they are trying to take my life."

   ^4But what is God's reply? "I have left myself seven thousand men who
   have never knelt to Baal!"

   ^5So too at the present time there is a remnant selected by God's
   mercy.

   ^6But if it is by his mercy, it is not for anything they have done.
   Otherwise, his mercy would not be mercy at all.

   ^7What follows? Israel failed to get what it sought, but those whom God
   selected got it.

   ^8The rest became callous; as the Scripture says, "God has thrown them
   into a state of spiritual insensibility, with eyes that cannot see and
   cars that cannot hear, that has lasted down to this day."

   ^9And David said,

   "Let their feasting prove a snare and a trap to them,

   Their ruin and their retribution.

   ^10Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see;

   Make their backs bend forever under their burden!"

   ^11I ask then, has their stumbling led to their absolute ruin? By no
   means. Through their false step salvation has gone to the heathen, so
   as to make the Israelites jealous.

   ^12But if their false step has so enriched the world, and their defeat
   has so enriched the heathen, how much more good the addition of their
   full number will do!

   ^13But it is to you who are of the heathen that I am speaking. So far
   then as I am an apostle to the heathen, I make the most of my ministry,

   ^14in the hope of making my countrymen jealous, and thus saving some of
   them.

   ^15For if their rejection has meant the reconciling of the world, what
   can the acceptance of them mean but life from the dead?

   ^16If the first handful of dough is consecrated, the whole mass is, and
   if the root of a tree is consecrated, so are its branches.

   ^17If some of the branches have been broken off, and you who were only
   a wild olive shoot have been grafted in, in place of them, and made to
   share the richness of the olive's root,

   ^18you must not look down upon the branches. If you do, remember that
   you do not support the root; the root supports you.

   ^19"But," you will say, "branches were broken off so that I could be
   grafted in!"

   ^20That is true; but it was for their want of faith that they were
   broken off, and it is through your faith that you stand where you do.
   You ought not to feel proud; you ought to be afraid,

   ^21for if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare
   you.

   ^22Observe then the goodness and the severity of God--severity to those
   who have fallen, but goodness to you, provided you abide by his
   goodness, for otherwise, you in your turn will be pruned away.

   ^23Those others too, if they do not cling to their unbelief, will be
   grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.

   ^24For if you were cut from a wild olive and unnaturally grafted upon a
   cultivated one, how much easier it will be to graft them upon the olive
   to which they properly belong!

   ^25For to keep you from thinking too well of yourselves, brothers, I do
   not want you to miss this secret, that only partial insensibility has
   come upon Israel, to last until all the heathen have come in,

   ^26and then all Israel will be saved, just as the Scripture says,

   "The deliverer will come from Zion,

   He will drive all ungodliness away from Jacob,

   ^27And this will be my agreement with them,

   When I take away their sins."

   ^28From the point of view of the good news they are treated as enemies
   of God on your account; but from the point of view of God's choice,
   they are dear to him because of their forefathers,

   ^29for God does not change his mind about those to whom he gives his
   blessings or sends his call.

   ^30For just as you once disobeyed God, but now have had mercy shown you
   because they disobeyed,

   ^31so they are now disobedient in order that they in turn may
   experience the same mercy as you.

   ^32For God has made all men prisoners of disobedience so as to have
   mercy upon them all.

   ^33How inexhaustible God's resources, wisdom, and knowledge are! How
   unfathomable his decisions are, and how untraceable his ways!

   ^34"Who has ever known the Lord's thoughts, or advised him?

   ^35"Or who has advanced anything to him, for which he will have to be
   repaid?"

   ^36For from him everything comes; through him everything exists; and in
   him everything ends! Glory to him forever! Amen.

  Chapter 12

   ^1I appeal to you, therefore, brothers, by this mercy of God, to offer
   your bodies in a living sacrifice that will be holy and acceptable to
   God; that is your rational worship.

   ^2You must not adopt the customs of this world but by your new attitude
   of mind be transformed so that you can find out what God's will
   is--what is good, pleasing, and perfect.

   ^3By the favor that God has shown me, I would tell every one of you not
   to think too highly of himself, but to think reasonably, judging
   himself by the degree of faith God has allowed him.

   ^4For just as there are many parts united in our human bodies, and the
   parts do not all have the same function,

   ^5so, many as we are, we form one body through union with Christ, and
   we are individually parts of one another.

   ^6We have gifts that differ with the favor that God has shown us,
   whether it is that of preaching, differing with the measure of our
   faith,

   ^7or of practical service, differing in the field of service, or the
   teacher who exercises his gift in teaching,

   ^8the speaker, in his exhortation, the giver of charity, with
   generosity, the office-holder, with devotion, the one who does acts of
   mercy, with cheerfulness.

   ^9Your love must be genuine. You must hate what is wrong, and hold to
   what is right.

   ^10Be affectionate in your love for the brotherhood, eager to show one
   another honor,

   ^11not wanting in devotion, but on fire with the Spirit. Serve the
   Lord.

   ^12Be happy in your hope, steadfast in time of trouble, persistent in
   prayer.

   ^13Supply the needs of God's people, be unfailing in hospitality.

   ^14Bless your persecutors; bless them; do not curse them.

   ^15Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.

   ^16Live in harmony with one another. Do not be too ambitious, but
   accept humble tasks. Do not be conceited.

   ^17Do not pay anyone back with evil for evil. See that you are above
   reproach in the eyes of everyone.

   ^18If possible, for your part, live peaceably with everybody.

   ^19Do not take your revenge, dear friends, but leave room for God's
   anger, for the Scripture says, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay
   them back, says the Lord."

   ^20No! If your enemy is hungry, feed him! If he is thirsty, give him
   something to drink! For if you do, you will heap burning coals upon his
   head!

   ^21Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   ^1Everyone must obey the authorities that are over him, for no
   authority can exist without the permission of God; the existing
   authorities have been established by him,

   ^2so that anyone who resists the authorities sets himself in opposition
   to what God has ordained, and those who oppose him will bring down
   judgment upon themselves.

   ^3The man who does right has nothing to fear from the magistrates, as
   the wrongdoer has. If you want to have no fear of the authorities, do
   right, and they will commend you for it,

   ^4for they are God's agents to do you good. But if you do wrong you may
   well be afraid, for they do not carry swords for nothing. They are
   God's servants, to execute his wrath upon wrongdoers.

   ^5You must obey them, therefore, not only to escape God's wrath, but as
   a matter of principle,

   ^6just as you pay your taxes; they are God's ministers, devoting
   themselves to this service.

   ^7Pay them all what is due them--tribute to the man entitled to receive
   it, taxes to the man entitled to receive them, respect to the man
   entitled to it, and honor to the man entitled to it.

   ^8Owe nobody anything--except the duty of mutual love, for whoever
   loves his fellow-men has fully satisfied the Law.

   ^9For the commandments, "You must not commit adultery, You must not
   murder, You must not steal, You must not covet," and any other
   commandments there are, are all summed up in one saying, "You must love
   your neighbor as you do yourself."

   ^10Love never wrongs a neighbor, and so love fully satisfies the Law.

   ^11All this especially, because you know this critical time and that it
   is time for you to wake from your sleep, for our salvation is nearer to
   us now than when we first believed.

   ^12The night is nearly over; the day is at hand. So let us throw aside
   the deeds of darkness, and put on the armor of light.

   ^13Let us live honorably, as in the light of day, not in carousing and
   drunkenness, or in immorality and indecency, or in quarreling and
   jealousy.

   ^14But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think
   about gratifying your physical cravings.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   ^1Treat people who are overscrupulous in their faith like brothers; do
   not criticize their views.

   ^2One man's faith allows him to eat anything, while the overscrupulous
   man eats nothing but vegetables.

   ^3The man who will eat anything must not look down on the man who
   abstains from some things, and the man who abstains from them must not
   criticize the one who does not, for God has accepted him.

   ^4Who are you to criticize someone else's servant? It is for his own
   master to say whether he succeeds or fails; and he will succeed, for
   the Master can make him do so.

   ^5One man thinks one day better than another, while another thinks them
   all alike. Everybody must be fully convinced in his own mind.

   ^6The man who observes the day does it in the Lord's honor. The man who
   eats does it in the Lord's honor, for he gives God thanks, and the man
   who abstains does it in the Lord's honor, and gives him thanks.

   ^7None of us lives only to himself, and none of us dies only to
   himself;

   ^8if we live, we are responsible to the Lord, and if we die, we are
   responsible to him; so whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.

   ^9For Christ died and returned to life for the very purpose of being
   Lord of both the dead and the living.

   ^10What business have you to criticize your brother? What business have
   you to look down upon your brother? We shall all have to stand before
   God for judgment.

   ^11For the Scripture says,

   "As surely as I live, says the Lord, every knee will bend before me,

   And every tongue will make its confession to God."

   ^12So each one of us must give an account of himself to God.

   ^13Therefore let us not criticize one another any more. You must
   resolve instead never to put any hindrance or obstacle in your
   brother's way.

   ^14I know and as a follower of the Lord Jesus I am convinced that
   nothing is unclean in itself; a thing is unclean only to the man who
   regards it as unclean.

   ^15For if your brother's feelings are hurt by what you eat, your life
   is not governed by love. You must not, by what you eat, ruin a man for
   whom Christ died.

   ^16The thing you have a right to do must not become a cause of
   reproach.

   ^17The Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of
   uprightness, peace, and happiness through the possession of the holy
   Spirit.

   ^18Whoever serves Christ in that way pleases God and gains the approval
   of men.

   ^19Let us, therefore, keep before us whatever will contribute to peace
   and the development of one another.

   ^20You must not, just for the sake of food, undo the work of God. It is
   true, everything is clean, but it is wrong for a man to hurt the
   consciences of others by what he eats.

   ^21The right thing to do is to eat no meat at all and to drink no wine
   or do anything else if it hurts your brother's conscience.

   ^22For your part, you must keep the faith you have to yourself, as
   between God and you. He is a happy man who has no fault to find with
   himself in following the course that he approves,

   ^23but the man who has misgivings about eating, and then eats, is
   thereby condemned, for he is not following his convictions, and
   anything that does not rest on conviction is wrong.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   ^1It is the duty of us who are strong to put up with the weaknesses of
   those who are immature, and not just suit ourselves.

   ^2Everyone of us must try to please his neighbor, to do him good, and
   help in his development.

   ^3Christ did not please himself, but as the Scripture says, "The
   reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me."

   ^4For everything that was written in earlier times was written for our
   instruction, so that by being steadfast and through the encouragement
   the Scriptures give, we might hold our hope fast.

   ^5May God, from whom steadfastness and encouragement come, give you
   such harmony with one another, in following the example of Christ
   Jesus,

   ^6that you may praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with
   one accord and one voice.

   ^7Therefore, treat one another like brothers, in God's honor, just as
   Christ has treated you.

   ^8I hold that Christ has become an agent of circumcision to show God's
   truthfulness in carrying out the promises made to our forefathers,

   ^9and causing the heathen to praise God for his mercy; as the Scripture
   says,

   "I will give thanks to you for this among the heathen,

   And sing in honor of your name."

   ^10And again,

   "Rejoice, you heathen, with his people!"

   ^11And again,

   "Praise the Lord, all you heathen,

   And let all nations sing his praises."

   ^12Again Isaiah says,

   "The descendant of Jesse will come,

   The one who is to rise to rule the heathen;

   The heathen will set their hopes on him."

   ^13May God, the source of hope, fill you with perfect happiness and
   peace in your faith, so that you may have overflowing hope through the
   power of the holy Spirit.

   ^14For my part, as far as you are concerned, my brothers, I am
   convinced that you are already full of goodness of heart, endowed with
   perfect knowledge, and well qualified to instruct one another.

   ^15But, just to refresh your memories, I have written you pretty boldly
   on some points, because of the favor God has shown me

   ^16in making me a minister of Christ Jesus among the heathen, to act as
   a priest of God's good news, to see that the heathen are an acceptable
   sacrifice, consecrated by the holy Spirit.

   ^17So as a follower of Christ Jesus I have reason to be proud of my
   work for God.

   ^18For I will venture to speak only of what Christ has accomplished
   through me in winning the heathen to obedience, by word and action,

   ^19by the force of signs and marvels, and by the power of the holy
   Spirit, with the result that I have completed the preaching of the good
   news of Christ all the way from Jerusalem around to Illyricum.

   ^20In all this it has been my ambition to preach the good news only
   where Christ's name was unknown, so as not to build on foundations
   other men had laid.

   ^21As the Scripture says,

   "They who have never been told of him will see,

   And they who have never heard will understand!"

   ^22This is why I have so often been prevented from coming to see you.

   ^23But now there is no more work for me in this part of the world, and
   as I have had a great desire for many years to come to see you,

   ^24when I go to Spain I hope to see you on my way there, and to have
   you see me off on my journey, after I have enjoyed being with you for a
   while.

   ^25Just now I am starting for Jerusalem, to take help to God's people.

   ^26For Macedonia and Greece have determined to make a contribution for
   the poor among God's people in Jerusalem.

   ^27They determined to do it, and they really are indebted to them, for
   if the heathen have shared their spiritual blessings, they ought to do
   them a service in material ways.

   ^28So when I have finished this matter, and seen this contribution
   safely into their possession, I will start for Spain, and come to you
   on the way,

   ^29and I know that when I do come to see you, I will come with Christ's
   fullest blessing.

   ^30I beg you, brothers, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of
   the love that the Spirit inspires, join me in most earnest prayer to
   God for me.

   ^31Pray that I may escape from those in Judea who are disobedient, and
   that the help I am taking to Jerusalem may be well received by God's
   people,

   ^32so that, if it is God's will, I may come with a glad heart to see
   you and enjoy a visit with you.

   ^33God who gives peace be with you all! Amen.

  Chapter 16

   ^1I want to introduce to you our sister Phoebe, who is a helper in the
   church at Cenchreae.

   ^2Welcome her as a Christian, as God's people should welcome one
   another, and give her whatever help she may need from you. For she has
   herself been a protection to many, including myself.

   ^3Remember me to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow-workers in the cause of
   Christ Jesus,

   ^4who risked their necks to save my life. Not only I but also all the
   churches among the heathen thank them. Remember me also to the church
   that meets at their house.

   ^5Remember me to my dear Epaenetus, who was the first man in Asia to
   turn to Christ.

   ^6Remember me to Mary, who has worked so hard for you.

   ^7Remember me to Andronicus and Junias, my fellow-countrymen, who went
   to prison with me. They are noted men among the missionaries, and they
   became Christians before I did.

   ^8Remember me to Ampliatus, my dear Christian friend.

   ^9Remember me to Urbanus, our fellow-worker in Christ's cause, and to
   my dear Stachys.

   ^10Remember me to that veteran Christian, Apelles. Remember me to those
   who belong to the household of Aristobulus.

   ^11Remember me to my fellow-countryman, Herodion. Remember me to the
   Christians in the household of Narcissus.

   ^12Remember me to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, those hard workers in the
   Lord's cause. Remember me to my dear Persis, who has worked so hard for
   the Lord,

   ^13Remember me to Rufus, that eminent Christian, and to his mother, who
   has been a mother to me.

   ^14Remember me to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and
   the brothers who meet with them.

   ^15Remember me to Philologus and Julia, to Nereus and his sister, and
   to Olympas, and all God's people who meet with them.

   ^16Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All the churches of Christ
   wish to be remembered to you.

   ^17I beg you, brothers, to be on the watch for those who introduce
   divisions and difficulties, in opposition to the instruction that you
   were given, and to avoid them.

   ^18Such men are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own base
   passions, and with their plausible and flattering talk they deceive
   simple-minded people.

   ^19Everyone has heard of your obedience, and I am very happy about you,
   but I want you to be wise about what is good and guileless about what
   is bad.

   ^20And God, who is the source of peace, will soon crush Satan under
   your feet.

   The blessing of our Lord Jesus be with you.

   ^21My fellow-worker, Timothy, wishes to be remembered to you, and so do
   Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow-countrymen.

   ^22I, Tertius, who write this letter, wish to be remembered to you as a
   fellow-Christian.

   ^23My host, Gaius, the host of the whole church, wishes to be
   remembered to you. Erastus, the city-treasurer, and our brother Quartus
   wish to be remembered to you.

   ^25To him who can make you strong by the good news I bring and the
   preaching about Jesus Christ, through the disclosure of the secret kept
   back for long ages but now revealed,

   ^26and at the command of the eternal God made known through the
   writings of the prophets to all the heathen, to lead them to obedience
   and faith--

   ^27to the one wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ. Amen.

The First Letter to the Corinthians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, by the will of God called as an apostle of Jesus Christ, and
   our brother Sosthenes,

   ^2to the church of God at Corinth, to those who are consecrated by
   union with Christ Jesus, and called as God's people, like all those
   anywhere who call on the name of Jesus Christ, their Lord as well as
   ours;

   ^3God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you
   peace.

   ^4I am always thanking God about you, for the blessing God has given
   you through Christ Jesus.

   ^5For you have grown rich in everything through union with him--in
   power of expression and in capacity for knowledge.

   ^6So your experience has confirmed the testimony that I bore to Christ,

   ^7and there is no gift that you lack even while you are waiting for our
   Lord Jesus Christ to reappear,

   ^8and at the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ he will insure your complete
   vindication.

   ^9God can be depended on, and it was he who called you to this
   fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

   ^10But I urge you all, brothers, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   to agree in what you say, and not to allow factions among you, but to
   be perfectly united in mind and judgment.

   ^11For I have been informed, my brothers, by Chloe's people, that
   quarrels are going on among you.

   ^12What I mean is this, that one of you says, "I am a follower of
   Paul," another, "And I, of Apollos," another, "And I, of Cephas," and
   another, "And I, of Christ!"

   ^13Christ has been divided up! But was it Paul who was crucified for
   you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?

   ^14I am thankful that I never baptized any of you except Crispus and
   Gaius,

   ^15so that no one could say that you were baptized in my name.

   ^16And I did baptize the members of the household of Stephanas too; I
   do not know whether I baptized anyone else besides.

   ^17For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the good
   news--but not with fine language, or the cross of Christ might seem an
   empty thing.

   ^18For to those who are on the way to destruction, the story of the
   cross is nonsense, but to us who are to be saved, it means all the
   power of God.

   ^19For the Scripture says,

   "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,

   And I will thwart the shrewdness of the shrewd!"

   ^20Where now is your philosopher? Your scribe? Your reasoner of today?
   Has not God made a fool of the world's wisdom?

   ^21For since in God's providence the world with all its wisdom did not
   come to know God, God chose, through the folly of the gospel message,
   to save those who had faith in him.

   ^22For Jews insist upon miracles, and Greeks demand philosophy,

   ^23but we proclaim a Christ who was crucified--an idea that is
   revolting to Jews and absurd to the heathen,

   ^24but to those whom God has called, whether they are Jews or Greeks, a
   Christ who is God's power and God's wisdom.

   ^25For God's folly is beyond the wisdom of men, and God's weakness is
   beyond their strength.

   ^26For consider, brothers, what happened when God called you. Not many
   of you were what men call wise, not many of you were influential, not
   many were of high birth.

   ^27But it was what the world calls foolish that God chose to put the
   wise to shame with, and it was what the world calls weak that God chose
   to shame its strength with,

   ^28and it was what the world calls low and insignificant and unreal
   that God chose to nullify its realities,

   ^29so that in his presence no human being might have anything to boast
   of.

   ^30But you are his children, through your union with Christ Jesus, whom
   God has made our wisdom--our uprightness and consecration and
   redemption,

   ^31so that, as the Scripture says, "Let him who would boast, boast of
   the Lord!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1So when I came to you, brothers, I did not come and tell you the
   secret purpose of God in superior, philosophical language,

   ^2for I resolved, while I was with you, to forget everything but Jesus
   Christ and his crucifixion.

   ^3For my part, I came among you in weakness and with a great deal of
   fear and trembling,

   ^4and my teaching and message were not put in plausible, philosophical
   language, but they were attended with convincing spiritual power,

   ^5so that your faith might rest, not on human philosophy, but on the
   power of God.

   ^6Yet there is a wisdom that we impart when we are with people who have
   a mature faith, but it is not what this world calls wisdom, nor what
   the authorities of this world, doomed as they are to pass away, would
   call so.

   ^7But it is a mysterious divine wisdom that we impart, hitherto kept
   secret, and destined by God before the world began for our glory.

   ^8It is a wisdom unknown to any of the authorities of this world, for
   otherwise they would never have crucified our glorious Lord.

   ^9But, as the Scripture says, there are things

   "Which no eye ever saw and no ear ever heard,

   And never occurred to the human mind,

   Which God has provided for those who love him."

   ^10For God revealed them to us through his Spirit, for the Spirit
   fathoms everything, even the depths of God himself.

   ^11For what human being can understand a man's thoughts except the
   man's own spirit within him? Just so no one understands the thoughts of
   God but the spirit of God.

   ^12But the Spirit we have received is not that of the world, but the
   Spirit that comes from God, which we have to make us realize the
   blessings God has given us.

   ^13These disclosures we impart, not in the set phrases of human
   philosophy, but in words the Spirit teaches, giving spiritual truth a
   spiritual form.

   ^14A material man will not accept what the Spirit of God offers. It
   seems mere folly to him, and he cannot understand it, because it takes
   spiritual insight to see its true value.

   ^15But the spiritual man is alive to all true values, but his own true
   value no unspiritual man can see.

   ^16For who has ever known the Lord's thoughts, so that he can instruct
   him? But we share the thoughts of Christ.

  Chapter 3

   ^1So, for my part, brothers, I could not treat you as spiritual
   persons; I had to treat you just as creatures of flesh and blood, as
   babies in Christian living.

   ^2I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it.

   Why, you are not ready for it now,

   ^3for you are still worldly. For when there are still jealousy and
   quarrels among you, are you not worldly and living on a merely human
   level?

   ^4For when one man says, "I am a follower of Paul," and another, "I am
   a follower of Apollos," are you not simply human?

   ^5What is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Just servants through whom you came
   to have faith, as the Lord gave each of us opportunity.

   ^6I did the planting, Apollos the watering, but it was God who made the
   plants grow.

   ^7So neither the planter nor the waterer counts for anything, but only
   God who makes the plants grow.

   ^8The planter and the waterer are all one, though each of us will be
   paid for his own work.

   ^9For we are fellow-laborers for God, and you are God's farm, God's
   building.

   ^10Like an expert builder, I laid a foundation, as God commissioned me
   to do, and now someone else is building upon it. But let everyone be
   careful how he does so.

   ^11For no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is laid,
   that is, Jesus Christ himself.

   ^12And whether one uses gold or silver or costly stone in building on
   the foundation, or wood or hay or straw,

   ^13the quality of everyone's work will appear, for the Day will show
   it. For the Day will break in fire, and the fire will test the quality
   of everyone's work.

   ^14If what a man has built on the foundation stands the test, he will
   have his pay.

   ^15If a man's work is burned up, he must stand the loss, though he
   himself will be saved, but as one who has passed through the fire.

   ^16Do you know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit makes
   its home in you?

   ^17If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the
   temple of God is sacred, and that is what you are.

   ^18Let no one of you deceive himself. If any one of you imagines that
   he is wiser than the rest of you, in what this world calls wisdom, he
   had better become a fool, so as to become really wise.

   ^19For this world's wisdom is foolishness to God. For the Scripture
   says, "He who catches the wise with their own cunning,"

   ^20and "The Lord knows that the deliberations of the wise are
   fruitless."

   ^21So no one should boast about men. For it all belongs to you--

   ^22Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, the
   future--all of it belongs to you.

   ^23But you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1The right way for a man to think of us is as Christ's servants, and
   managers authorized to distribute the secret truths of God.

   ^2Now further, what is always demanded of managers is that they can be
   depended on.

   ^3I for my part care very little about being examined by you or by any
   human court. I do not even offer myself for investigation.

   ^4For while my conscience does not trouble me at all, that does not
   prove that I am innocent. It is the Lord who must examine me.

   ^5Do not form any premature judgments, therefore, but wait until the
   Lord comes back. For he will light up the darkness that now hides
   things and show what the motives in people's minds are, and then
   everyone will get from God the praise he deserves.

   ^6Now, brothers, for your benefit I have applied all this only to
   Apollos and myself, by using us as illustrations to teach you the old
   lesson, "Never go beyond the letter," and to keep any of you from
   boasting of one teacher at the expense of another.

   ^7For who sees anything special in you? And what have you got that you
   have not been given? But if it has been given you, why do you boast as
   though it had not been?

   ^8Are you satisfied already? Have you become rich already? Have you
   entered your kingdom without waiting for us? I wish you had entered it,
   so that we might share it with you!

   ^9For it seems to me, God has exhibited us apostles at the very end of
   the procession, like the men condemned to die in the arena. For we have
   become a spectacle to the whole universe, angels as well as men.

   ^10We are made fools of, for the sake of Christ, while you are men of
   sense, through being united with him. We are weak, you are strong. You
   are distinguished, we are despised.

   ^11To this day we have gone hungry, thirsty, and ill-clad; we have had
   rough usage, we have had no home,

   ^12we have worked with our hands for a living. When people abuse us, we
   bless them, when they persecute us, we put up with it,

   ^13when they slander us, we try to conciliate them. We have come to be
   like the scum of the earth, the dregs of the world, and we are so now.

   ^14I do not write this to you to make you ashamed, but for your
   instruction as my dear children.

   ^15For no matter how many guides you may have in the Christian life,
   you will not have many fathers; for in this matter of union with
   Christ, I became your father, through preaching the good news to you.

   ^16So I urge you, follow my example.

   ^17This is why I have sent Timothy to you. He is a dear child of mine,
   in the service of the Lord, and one on whom you can depend, and he will
   help you to keep in mind my methods in the service of Christ Jesus,
   which I follow everywhere in every church.

   ^18Some of you seem to think that I am not coming to visit you, and are
   putting on airs about it.

   ^19But I am coming very soon to see you, if the Lord is willing, and
   then I will find out, not what these conceited people have to say, but
   what they can actually do.

   ^20For the reign of God is not a matter of words but of power.

   ^21Which will you have? Shall I come to you with a stick, or in a
   loving and gentle spirit?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1Immorality is actually notorious among you, and immorality of a kind
   unknown even among the heathen--that a man has taken his father's wife.

   ^2And can you put on airs, instead of being overwhelmed with grief at
   having to expel from your number the man who has done this?

   ^3For my part, though I have been absent from you in person, I have
   been present with you in spirit, and as thus present I have already
   passed judgment upon the man who has done this,

   ^4and meeting with you, in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, by
   the authority of our Lord Jesus

   ^5I have handed the man over to Satan, for his physical destruction, in
   order that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.

   ^6Certainly this is nothing for you to boast of. Do you not know that a
   little yeast will affect all the dough?

   ^7You must clean out the old yeast and become fresh dough, free from
   the old as you really are. For our Passover lamb is already sacrificed;
   it is Christ himself.

   ^8So let us keep the festival, not with old yeast nor with the yeast of
   vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of purity and truth.

   ^9I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people--

   ^10not that you are to have nothing whatever to do with the immoral
   people of the world, any more than with its greedy and grasping people
   or idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world altogether.

   ^11What I meant was that you are not to associate with anyone who is
   supposed to be a Christian brother, and yet is immoral or greedy or
   idolatrous or abusive or drunken or grasping--with such a person you
   must not even eat.

   ^12For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not your part to
   judge those who are inside the church,

   ^13and God's, to judge those who are outside? You must drive the
   wrongdoer out from among you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1When one of you has a disagreement with his neighbor, does he dare to
   bring the matter before a heathen court, instead of laying it before
   his Christian brothers?

   ^2Do you not know that the Christians are to be the judges of the
   world? And if the world is to come before you for judgment, are you
   unfit to decide the most trivial cases?

   ^3Do you not know that we are to be the judges of angels, to say
   nothing of ordinary matters?

   ^4If then you have ordinary matters to be settled, will you submit them
   for judgment to men who are nothing in the church?

   ^5I ask it to shame you. Has it come to this, that there is not a
   single wise man among you who could settle a disagreement between one
   brother and another,

   ^6but one Christian has to go to law with another, and before
   unbelievers too?

   ^7Having lawsuits with one another at all means your utter failure, to
   begin with. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be robbed?

   ^8But it is you who wrong and rob others, and your own brothers at
   that!

   ^9Do you not know that wrongdoers will not have any share in God's
   kingdom? Do not let anyone mislead you. People who are immoral or
   idolaters or adulterers or sensual or given to unnatural vice

   ^10or thieves or greedy--drunkards, abusive people, robbers--will not
   have any share in God's kingdom.

   ^11Some of you used to be like that; but you have washed it all away,
   you have been consecrated, you have become upright, by the power of our
   Lord Jesus Christ and through the Spirit of our God.

   ^12I may do anything I please, but not everything I may do is good for
   me. I may do anything I please; but I am not going to let anything
   master me.

   ^13It is true, food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for the
   food, but God will put an end to both of them. But the body is not
   meant for immorality, but for the service of the Lord, and the Lord is
   for the body to serve.

   ^14And as God raised the Lord to life, he will raise us also by his
   power.

   ^15Do you not know that your bodies are parts of Christ's body? Am I
   then to take away from Christ parts of his body, and make them parts of
   a prostitute's? Never!

   ^16Or do you not know that a man who has to do with a prostitute makes
   one body with her? For "The two," says the Scripture, "shall become
   physically one."

   ^17But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.

   ^18Fly from immorality! Any other sin a man commits is something
   outside his body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.

   ^19Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy Spirit
   that is within you, which you have received from God? Besides, you are
   not your own;

   ^20you have been bought and paid for. Therefore, honor God with your
   bodies.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1As to the matters of which you wrote me, it is an excellent thing for
   a man to remain unmarried.

   ^2But there is so much immorality that every man had better have a wife
   of his own, and every woman a husband of her own.

   ^3The husband must give his wife what is due her, and the wife must do
   the same by her husband.

   ^4A wife cannot do as she likes with her own person; it is her
   husband's; and in the same way a husband cannot do as he likes with his
   own person; it is his wife's.

   ^5You must not refuse each other what is due, unless you agree to do so
   for a while, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then to come together
   again, so that Satan may not tempt you through your lack of
   self-control.

   ^6But I mean this as a concession, not a command.

   ^7I should like to have everyone be just as I am myself; but each one
   has his own special gift from God, one of one kind, and one of another.

   ^8To all who are unmarried and to widows, I would say this: It is an
   excellent thing if they can remain single as I am.

   ^9But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry. For it is
   better to marry than to be on fire with passion.

   ^10To those already married my instructions are--and they are not mine,
   but the Lord's--that a wife is not to separate from her husband.

   ^11If she does separate, she must remain single or else become
   reconciled to him. And a husband must not divorce his wife.

   ^12To other people I would say, though not as Christ's command, if a
   Christian has a wife who is not a believer, and she is willing to live
   with him, he must not divorce her,

   ^13and a woman who has a husband who is not a believer, but is willing
   to live with her, must not divorce her husband.

   ^14For the husband who is not a believer is consecrated through union
   with his wife, and the woman who is not a believer is consecrated
   through union with her Christian husband, for otherwise your children
   would be unblessed, but, as it is, they are consecrated.

   ^15But if the one who is not a believer wishes to separate, let the
   separation take place. In such cases the brother or sister is not a
   slave; God has called you to live in peace.

   ^16For how do you wives know whether you will save your husbands? Or
   how do you husbands know whether you will save your wives?

   ^17Only, everyone must continue in the station which the Lord has
   appointed for him, and in which he was when God's call came to him.
   This is the rule I make in all the churches.

   ^18If a man was circumcised when he was called, he must not try to
   alter it. If a man was uncircumcised when he was called, he must not
   have himself circumcised.

   ^19Being circumcised or being uncircumcised does not make any
   difference; all that matters is keeping God's commands.

   ^20Everyone ought to remain in the station in which he was called.

   ^21If you were a slave when you were called, never mind. Even if you
   can gain your freedom, make the most of your present condition instead.

   ^22For a slave who has been called to union with the Lord is a freedman
   of the Lord, just as a free man who has been called is a slave of
   Christ.

   ^23You have been bought and paid for; you must not let yourselves
   become slaves to men.

   ^24Brothers, everyone must remain in fellowship with God in the station
   in which he was called.

   ^25About unmarried women I have no command of the Lord to give you, but
   I will give you my opinion as that of one on whom through the Lord's
   mercy you can depend.

   ^26This, then, is my opinion in view of the present distress--that it
   is a good thing for a man to remain just as he is.

   ^27If you are united to a wife, do not seek to be released. If you are
   not, do not seek a wife.

   ^28But if you do marry, there is no sin in that. And if a girl marries,
   it is no sin. But those who marry will have worldly trouble, which I
   would like to spare you.

   ^29But this I do say, brothers. The appointed time has grown very
   short. From this time on those who have wives should live as though
   they had none,

   ^30and those who mourn as though they did not mourn, and those who are
   glad as though they were not glad, and those who buy anything as though
   they did not own it,

   ^31and those who mix in the world, as though they were not absorbed in
   it. For the present shape of the world is passing away.

   ^32I want you to be free from all anxiety. An unmarried man is
   concerned about the Lord's work, and how he can please the Lord.

   ^33A married man is concerned about worldly affairs, and how he can
   please his wife, and so his interests are divided.

   ^34An unmarried woman or a girl is concerned about the Lord's work, so
   as to be consecrated in body and spirit, but the woman who marries is
   concerned with worldly affairs, and how she can please her husband.

   ^35It is for your benefit that I say this, not to put a halter on you,
   but to promote good order, and to secure your undivided devotion to the
   Lord.

   ^36But if a man thinks he is not acting properly toward the girl to
   whom he is engaged, if his passions are too strong, and that is what
   ought to be done, let him do as he pleases; it is no sin; let them be
   married.

   ^37But a man who has definitely made up his mind, under no constraint
   of passion but with full self-control, and who has decided in his own
   mind to keep her as she is, will be doing what is right.

   ^38So the man who marries her does what is right, and the man who
   refrains from doing so does even better.

   ^39A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband
   dies, she is free to marry anyone she pleases so long as he is a
   Christian.

   ^40But she will be happier, in my judgment, if she remains as she is,
   and I think I have God's spirit as well as other people.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1About food that has been offered to idols, it is true, as you say,
   that we all have some knowledge on that matter. Knowledge gives people
   airs; love is what builds up character.

   ^2If a man thinks he has acquired some knowledge, he does not yet know
   it as well as he ought to know it.

   ^3But if a man loves God, God is known by him.

   ^4As to eating things, then, that have been offered to idols, we all
   know that no idol has any real existence, and that there is no God but
   one.

   ^5For supposing there are so-called gods in heaven or on earth--and
   indeed there are plenty of such gods and lords--

   ^6yet for us there is just one God, the Father, who is the source of
   all things, and for whom we live, and just one Lord, Jesus Christ,
   through whom everything was made and through whom we live.

   ^7But it is not everyone that has this knowledge; for some, through
   being long accustomed to idols, still eat meat that has been sacrificed
   to them as really offered to an idol, and their consciences, being
   oversensitive, are troubled.

   ^8But food is not going to affect our standing with God. We are none
   the worse if we do not eat it, and none the better if we do.

   ^9But you must take care that this right of yours does not prove a
   hindrance to the overscrupulous.

   ^10For if somebody sees you, who are intelligent about this matter,
   attending a dinner in an idol's temple, will not he, with his sensitive
   conscience, be led to eat meat that is offered to idols?

   ^11For this overscrupulous brother, for whom Christ died, is ruined by
   what you call your knowledge.

   ^12But in sinning against your brothers in this way and wounding their
   too scrupulous consciences, you are really sinning against Christ.

   ^13Therefore, if what I eat makes my brother fall, I will never eat
   meat again, rather than make my brother fall.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   ^1Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?
   Are you not the product of my work in the Lord's service?

   ^2If I am not an apostle to other people, I certainly am one to you,
   for you yourselves, in your relation to the Lord, are the certificate
   of my apostleship.

   ^3My answer to those who want to investigate me is this:

   ^4Have we not a right to our food and drink?

   ^5Have we not a right to take a Christian wife about with us, like the
   rest of the apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas?

   ^6Or is it only Barnabas and I that have no right to give up working
   for a living?

   ^7What soldier ever pays his expenses out of his own pay? Who plants a
   vineyard and does not eat any of the grapes? Who tends a flock and does
   not get any of the milk?

   ^8Am I saying only what men say? Does not the Law say so too?

   ^9For in the Law of Moses it reads, "You shall not muzzle an ox that is
   treading out the grain." Is it about the oxen that God is concerned?

   ^10Is he not clearly speaking in our interests? Of course this law was
   written in our interests, because the plowman ought to plow, and the
   thresher to thresh, in the expectation of sharing in the crop.

   ^11If it was we who sowed the spiritual seed among you, is it too much
   if we reap material benefits from you?

   ^12If others enjoy such rights over you, have we not a still better
   claim? But, you say, we have never availed ourselves of this right. No,
   we will stand anything rather than put any hindrance in the way of the
   good news of the Christ.

   ^13Do you not know that those who do the work about the Temple get
   their living from the Temple, and those who attend to the altar divide
   the sacrifices with the altar?

   ^14In just that way the Lord directed that those who preach the good
   news should get their living from it.

   ^15But I have not availed myself of any of these rights. And I am not
   writing this now so that I may become an illustration of this; I had
   rather die than do that. No one shall deprive me of this boast of mine.

   ^16As far as preaching the good news is concerned, that is nothing for
   me to boast of, for I cannot help doing it. For I am ruined if I do not
   preach.

   ^17For if I do it of my own accord, I have my pay, but if I do it
   because I must, it is still a responsibility that I am charged with.

   ^18What pay then do I get? Why, that in my preaching I can offer the
   good news without cost, and so not take full advantage of my rights as
   a preacher.

   ^19Though I am free from anyone's control, I have made myself
   everyone's slave, so as to win over all the more.

   ^20To the Jews I have become like a Jew, to win Jews over; to men under
   the Law I have become like a man under the Law, though I am not myself
   under the Law, so as to win over those who are under the Law.

   ^21To those who have no law I have become like a man without any
   law--though I am not without the law of God, but under the law of
   Christ--so as to win over those who are without any law.

   ^22To the overscrupulous I have become overscrupulous, so as to win the
   overscrupulous; I have become everything to everybody, so as by all
   means to save some of them.

   ^23And I do it all for the sake of the good news, so that I may share
   in its blessings along with the rest.

   ^24Do you not know that in a race the runners all compete, but only one
   wins the prize? That is the way you must run, so as to win.

   ^25Any man who enters an athletic contest goes into strict training, to
   win a wreath that will soon wither, but the one we compete for will
   never wither.

   ^26So that is the way I run, unswervingly. That is the way I fight, not
   punching the air.

   ^27But I beat and bruise my body and make it my slave, so that after I
   have called others to the contest I may not be disqualified myself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1For I would not have you forget, brothers, that though our
   forefathers were all protected by the cloud, and all passed safely
   through the sea,

   ^2and in the cloud and the sea all, as it were, accepted baptism as
   followers of Moses,

   ^3and all ate the same supernatural food

   ^4and drank the same supernatural drink--for they used to drink from a
   supernatural rock which attended them, and the rock was really Christ--

   ^5still most of them disappointed God, for they were struck down in the
   desert.

   ^6Now these things happened to warn us, so that we should not long for
   what is evil as they did.

   ^7You must not become idolaters, like some of them, for the Scripture
   says, "The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to dance."

   ^8Let us not practice immorality, like some of them, twenty-three
   thousand of whom fell dead in one day,

   ^9Let us not try the Lord's patience too far, as some of them did, for
   they were killed for it by the snakes.

   ^10You must not grumble, as some of them did, for they were destroyed
   for it by the destroying angel.

   ^11These things happened to them as a warning to others, but they were
   written down to instruct us, in whose days the ages have reached their
   climax.

   ^12So the man who thinks he can stand must be on his guard against a
   fall.

   ^13It is no superhuman temptation that you have had. And God can be
   depended on, not to let you be tried beyond your strength, but when
   temptation comes, to give you a way out of it, so that you can
   withstand it.

   ^14Therefore, my dear brothers, have nothing to do with the worship of
   idols.

   ^15I appeal to your good sense. Make up your minds about what I say.

   ^16Does not the consecrated cup which we bless mean that in drinking it
   we share in the blood of Christ? Does not the bread that we break mean
   that in eating it we share in the body of Christ?

   ^17Because there is one loaf, we, many as we are, are one body, for we
   all share the one loaf.

   ^18Think of the Israelites' practices. Do not those who eat what is
   sacrificed have divine fellowship at the sacrificial altar?

   ^19What am I saying then? That there is any such thing as being offered
   to an idol, or any such thing as an idol?

   ^20No, but that what the heathen sacrifice they offer to demons and not
   to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.

   ^21You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You
   cannot eat at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons.

   ^22Or are we trying to arouse the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger
   than he is?

   ^23We are free to do anything, but not everything is good for us. We
   are free to do anything, but not everything builds up character.

   ^24No one should look after his own advantage but after that of his
   neighbor.

   ^25Eat anything for sale in the meat market without raising any
   question, as far as conscience is concerned,

   ^26for the earth and everything in it belongs to the Lord.

   ^27If one of the heathen invites you to his house, and you wish to go,
   eat whatever is served, without raising any question, as far as
   conscience is concerned.

   ^28But if someone says to you, "This meat has been offered in
   sacrifice," let it alone, on account of the man who told you and his
   conscientious scruples;

   ^29his scruples, I say, not yours. For why should my liberty of action
   be limited by another's scruples?

   ^30If I give thanks for what I eat, why should I be denounced for
   eating what I give thanks over?

   ^31So whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do it
   all to the honor of God.

   ^32You must not be hindrances to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God
   either,

   ^33just as I for my part try to please everyone in all I do, not aiming
   at my own advantage, but at that of people generally, in order that
   they may be saved.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1You must follow my example in this, as I am following Christ's.

   ^2I appreciate your always remembering me, and your standing by the
   things I passed on to you, just as you received them.

   ^3But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man,
   while a woman's head is her husband, and Christ's head is God.

   ^4Any man who offers prayer or explains the will of God with anything
   on his head disgraces his head,

   ^5and any woman who offers prayer or explains the will of God
   bareheaded disgraces her head, for it is just as though she had her
   head shaved.

   ^6For if a woman will not wear a veil, let her cut off her hair too.
   But if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her
   head shaved, let her wear a veil.

   ^7For a man ought not to wear anything on his head, for he is the image
   of God and reflects his glory; while woman is the reflection of man's
   glory.

   ^8For man was not made from woman, but woman from man,

   ^9and man was not created for woman, but woman was for man.

   ^10That is why she ought to wear upon her head something to symbolize
   her subjection, out of respect to the angels, if to nobody else.

   ^11But in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man nor man
   of woman.

   ^12For just as woman was made from man, man is born of woman, and both
   like everything else really come from God.

   ^13Judge for yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to offer prayer to
   God with nothing on her head?

   ^14Does not nature itself teach you that for a man to wear his hair
   long is degrading,

   ^15but a woman's long hair is her pride? For her hair is given her as a
   covering.

   ^16But if anyone is disposed to be contentious about it, I for my part
   recognize no other practice in worship than this, and neither do the
   churches of God.

   ^17But while I am on this subject, I cannot approve of your meetings,
   because they are doing you more harm than good.

   ^18For, in the first place, when you meet as a congregation, I hear
   that you divide into sets, and in a measure I believe it.

   ^19Doubtless there must be parties among you, if those who are right
   are to be recognized among you.

   ^20So when you hold your meetings it is not the Lord's Supper that you
   eat,

   ^21for each of you hurries to get his own supper and eat it, and one
   goes hungry while another gets drunk.

   ^22Have you no houses to eat and drink in? Or do you mean to show your
   contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate those who have none?
   What can I say to you? Can I approve of you? Not in this matter
   certainly.

   ^23For I myself received from the Lord the account that I passed on to
   you, that the Lord Jesus the night he was betrayed took some bread

   ^24and gave thanks for it and then broke it in pieces, saying, "This is
   my body which takes your place. Do this in memory of me."

   ^25He took the cup, too, after supper, in the same way, saying, "This
   cup is the new agreement ratified by my blood. Whenever you drink it,
   do so in memory of me."

   ^26For until the Lord comes back, every time you eat this bread and
   drink from the cup, you proclaim his death.

   ^27Hence anyone who eats the bread or drinks from the Lord's cup in a
   way that is unworthy of it will be guilty of profaning the body and the
   blood of the Lord.

   ^28A man should examine himself, and only when he has done so should he
   eat any of the bread or drink from the cup.

   ^29For anyone who eats and drinks, eats and drinks a judgment upon
   himself if he does not recognize the body.

   ^30This is why many of you are sick and ill and a number have fallen
   asleep.

   ^31But if we recognized our own condition, we would not incur this
   judgment.

   ^32But since we do incur it, we are disciplined by the Lord, so that we
   may not be condemned along with the world.

   ^33So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one
   another.

   ^34If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that your meetings may
   not bring down a judgment upon you. The details I will settle when I
   come.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1About spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be misinformed.

   ^2You know that when you were heathen you would stray off, as impulse
   directed, to idols that could not speak.

   ^3Therefore, I must tell you that no one who is speaking under the
   influence of the Spirit of God ever says, "Curse Jesus!" and no one can
   say, "Jesus is Lord!" without being under the influence of the holy
   Spirit.

   ^4Endowments vary, but the Spirit is the same,

   ^5and forms of service vary, but it is the same Lord who is served,

   ^6and activities vary, but God who produces them all in us all is the
   same.

   ^7Each one is given his spiritual illumination for the common good.

   ^8One man receives through the Spirit the power to speak wisely,
   another, by the same Spirit, receives the power to express knowledge,

   ^9another, from his union with the same Spirit receives faith, another,
   by one and the same Spirit, the ability to cure the sick,

   ^10another, the working of wonders, another, inspiration in preaching,
   another, the power of distinguishing the true Spirit from false ones,
   another, various ecstatic utterances, and another, the ability to
   explain them.

   ^11These are all produced by one and the same Spirit, and apportioned
   to each of us just as the Spirit chooses.

   ^12For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the
   parts of the body, many as they are, form one body, so it is with
   Christ.

   ^13For we have all--Jews or Greeks, slaves or free men--been baptized
   in one spirit to form one body, and we have all been saturated with one
   Spirit.

   ^14For the body does not consist of one part but of many.

   ^15If the foot says, "As I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,"
   that does not make it any less a part of the body.

   ^16And if the ear says, "As I am not an eye, I am not a part of the
   body," that does not make it any less a part of the body.

   ^17If all the body were eye, how would we hear? If it were all ear, how
   could we have a sense of smell?

   ^18As it is, God has arranged the parts, every one of them in the body
   as he wished them to be.

   ^19If they were all one part, where would the body be?

   ^20As it is, there are many parts, but one body.

   ^21The eye cannot say to the hand, "I do not need you," or the head to
   the feet, "I do not need you."

   ^22On the contrary, the parts of the body that are considered most
   delicate are indispensable,

   ^23and the parts of it that we think common, we dress with especial
   care, and our unpresentable parts receive especial attention

   ^24which our presentable parts do not need. God has so adjusted the
   body and given such especial distinction to its inferior parts

   ^25that there is no clash in the body, but its parts all alike care for
   one another.

   ^26If one part suffers, all the parts share its sufferings. If a part
   has honor done it, all the parts enjoy it too.

   ^27Now you are Christ's body, and individually parts of it.

   ^28And God has placed people in the church, first as apostles, second
   as inspired preachers, third as teachers, then wonder-workers; then
   come ability to cure the sick, helpfulness, administration, ecstatic
   speaking.

   ^29Is everyone an apostle? Is everyone an inspired preacher? Is
   everyone a teacher? Is everyone a wonder-worker?

   ^30Is everyone able to cure the sick? Can everyone speak ecstatically?
   Can everyone explain what it means?

   ^31But you must cultivate the higher endowments.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   ^1I will show you a far better way. If I can speak the languages of men
   and even of angels, but have no love, I am only a noisy gong or a
   clashing cymbal.

   ^2If I am inspired to preach and know all the secret truths and possess
   all knowledge, and if I have such perfect faith that I can move
   mountains, but have no love, I am nothing.

   ^3Even if I give away everything I own, and give myself up, but do it
   in pride, not love, it does me no good.

   ^4Love is patient and kind. Love is not envious or boastful. It does
   not put on airs.

   ^5It is not rude. It does not insist on its rights. It does not become
   angry. It is not resentful.

   ^6It is not happy over injustice, it is only happy with truth.

   ^7It will bear anything, believe anything, hope for anything, endure
   anything.

   ^8Love will never die out. If there is inspired preaching, it will pass
   away. If there is ecstatic speaking, it will cease. If there is
   knowledge, it will pass away.

   ^9For our knowledge is imperfect and our preaching is imperfect.

   ^10But when perfection comes, what is imperfect will pass away.

   ^11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I
   reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put aside my childish
   ways.

   ^12For now we are looking at a dim reflection in a mirror, but then we
   shall see face to face. Now my knowledge is imperfect, but then I shall
   know as fully as God knows me.

   ^13So faith, hope, and love endure. These are the great three, and the
   greatest of them is love.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   ^1You must pursue love, while you are cultivating the spiritual
   endowments, and especially inspired preaching.

   ^2For anyone who speaks ecstatically is speaking not to men but to God,
   for no one can understand him, though he is uttering secret truths.

   ^3But the inspired preacher does his fellow-men good and encourages and
   comforts them.

   ^4Anyone who speaks ecstatically does himself good, but the inspired
   preacher does a congregation good.

   ^5I want you all to speak ecstatically, but I especially want you to be
   inspired to preach. The man who is inspired to preach is more useful
   than the one who speaks ecstatically--unless he can explain what he
   says so that it may do the church some good.

   ^6But as it is brothers, if I come back to you and speak ecstatically,
   what good will I do you, unless I have some revelation or special
   knowledge or message or teaching to give you?

   ^7Even inanimate things, like the flute or the harp, may produce sound,
   but if there is no difference in the notes, how can you tell what is
   being played?

   ^8If the bugle does not sound a clear call, who will prepare for
   battle?

   ^9So if you in your ecstatic speaking utter words no one can
   understand, how will people know what you are saying? You will be
   talking to the empty air!

   ^10There are probably ever so many different languages in the world,
   each with its own meaning.

   ^11So if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall seem to the
   man who is speaking to be a foreigner, and he will seem to me to be one
   too.

   ^12So since you are ambitious for spiritual endowments, you must try to
   excel in them in ways that will do good to the church.

   ^13Therefore, the man who can speak ecstatically should pray for the
   power to explain what he says.

   ^14For if I pray ecstatically, it is my spirit that prays, but my mind
   is helping nobody.

   ^15Then what am I to do? I will pray ecstatically, but I will pray
   intelligently too. I will sing ecstatically, but I will sing
   intelligently too.

   ^16For if you utter blessings in ecstatic speech, how is an ordinary
   man to say Amen to your thanksgiving? For he does not know what you are
   saying.

   ^17You are giving thanks well enough, but it is doing him no good.

   ^18Thank God, I speak in ecstasy more than any of you.

   ^19But in public worship I would rather say five words with my
   understanding so as to instruct others also than ten thousand words in
   an ecstasy.

   ^20Brothers, you must not be children mentally. In evil be babies, but
   mentally be mature.

   ^21In the Law it says, "By men of strange languages and by the lips of
   foreigners I will speak to this nation, and not even then will they
   listen to me, says the Lord."

   ^22So this ecstatic speaking is meant as a sign not to those who
   believe but to unbelievers, but inspired preaching is a sign not to
   unbelievers but to those who believe.

   ^23Hence, if the whole church assembles and they all speak
   ecstatically, and ordinary people or unbelievers come in, will they not
   say that you are crazy?

   ^24But if they are all inspired to preach and some unbeliever or
   outsider comes in, he is convinced of his sin by them all, he is called
   to account by them all,

   ^25the secrets of his heart are exposed, and he will fall down on his
   face and worship God, and declare that God is really among you.

   ^26Then what is the right course, brothers? When you meet together,
   suppose every one of you has a song, a teaching, a revelation, an
   ecstatic utterance, or an explanation of one; it must all be for the
   good of all.

   ^27If there is any ecstatic speaking, let it be limited to two or three
   people at the most, and have one speak at a time and someone explain
   what he says.

   ^28But if there is no one to explain it, have him keep quiet in church,
   and talk to himself and to God.

   ^29And let two or three who are inspired to preach speak, while the
   rest weigh what is said;

   ^30and if anything is revealed to another who is seated, the one who is
   speaking must stop.

   ^31For in this way you can all preach one after another, as you are
   inspired to, so that everyone may be instructed and stimulated,

   ^32for the spirits of prophets will give way to prophets,

   ^33for God is not a God of disorder but of peace. This is the rule in
   all Christian churches.

   ^34Women are to keep quiet in church, for they are not allowed to
   speak. They must take a subordinate place, just as the Law says.

   ^35If they want to find out about anything, they should ask their
   husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church.

   ^36Did God's message start from you Corinthians? Or are you the only
   people it has reached?

   ^37If anyone claims to be inspired to preach, or to have any other
   spiritual endowment, let him understand that what I am now writing you
   is a command from the Lord.

   ^38If anyone pays no attention to it, pay no attention to him.

   ^39So, my brothers, set your hearts on being inspired to preach, and
   yet do not hinder people from speaking ecstatically.

   ^40But let everything be done in a proper and orderly way.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   ^1Now I want to remind you, brothers, of the form in which I presented
   to you the good news I brought, which you accepted and have stood by,

   ^2and through which you are to be saved, if you hold on, unless your
   faith has been all for nothing.

   ^3For I passed on to you, as of first importance, the account I had
   received, that Christ died for our sins, as the Scriptures foretold,

   ^4that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised from the
   dead, as the Scriptures foretold,

   ^5and that he was seen by Cephas, and then by the Twelve.

   ^6After that he was seen by more than five hundred brothers at one
   time, most of whom are still alive, although some of them have fallen
   asleep.

   ^7Then he was seen by James, then by all the apostles,

   ^8and finally he was seen by me also, as though I were born at the
   wrong time.

   ^9For I am the least important of the apostles, and am not fit to be
   called an apostle, because I once persecuted God's church.

   ^10But by God's favor I have become what I am, and the favor he showed
   me has not gone for nothing, but I have worked harder than any of them,
   although it was not really I but the favor God showed me.

   ^11But whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is
   what you believed.

   ^12Now if what we preach about Christ is that he was raised from the
   dead, how can some of you say that there is no such thing as a
   resurrection of the dead?

   ^13If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ was not raised,

   ^14and if Christ was not raised, there is nothing in our message; there
   is nothing in our faith either,

   ^15and we are found guilty of misrepresenting God, for we have
   testified that he raised Christ, when he did not do it, if it is true
   that the dead are never raised.

   ^16For if the dead are never raised, Christ was not raised;

   ^17and if Christ was not raised, your faith is a delusion; you are
   still under the control of your sins.

   ^18Yes, and those who have fallen asleep in trust in Christ have
   perished.

   ^19If we have centered our hopes on Christ in this life, and that is
   all, we are the most pitiable people in the world.

   ^20But the truth is, Christ was raised from the dead, the first to be
   raised of those who have fallen asleep.

   ^21For since it was through a man that we have death, it is through a
   man also that we have the raising of the dead.

   ^22For just as because of their relation to Adam all men die, so
   because of their relation to Christ they will all be brought to life
   again.

   ^23But each in his own turn; Christ first, and then at Christ's coming
   those who belong to him.

   ^24After that will come the end, when he will turn over the kingdom to
   God his Father, bringing to an end all other government, authority, and
   power,

   ^25for he must retain the kingdom until he puts all his enemies under
   his feet.

   ^26The last enemy to be overthrown will be death,

   ^27for everything is to be reduced to subjection and put under Christ's
   feet. But when it says that everything is subject to him, he is
   evidently excepted who reduced it all to subjection to him.

   ^28And when everything is reduced to subjection to him, then the Son
   himself will also become subject to him who has reduced everything to
   subjection to him, so that God may be everything to everyone.

   ^29Otherwise, what do people mean by having themselves baptized on
   behalf of their dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why do they have
   themselves baptized on their behalf?

   ^30Why do we ourselves run such risks every hour?

   ^31By the very pride I take in you, brothers, through our union with
   Christ Jesus our Lord, I face death every day.

   ^32From the human point of view, what good is it to me that I have
   fought wild animals here in Ephesus? If the dead do not rise at all,
   "Let us eat and drink, for we will be dead tomorrow!"

   ^33Do not be misled. Bad company ruins character.

   ^34Return to your sober sense as you ought, and stop sinning, for some
   of you are utterly ignorant about God. To your shame I say so.

   ^35But someone will say, "How can the dead rise? What kind of a body
   will they have when they come back?"

   ^36You foolish man, the very seed you sow never comes to life without
   dying first;

   ^37and when you sow it, it has not the form it is going to have, but is
   a naked kernel, perhaps of wheat or something else;

   ^38and God gives it just such a form as he pleases, so that each kind
   of seed has a form of its own.

   ^39Flesh is not all alike; men have one kind, animals another, birds
   another, and fish another.

   ^40There are heavenly bodies, and there are earthly bodies, but the
   beauty of the heavenly bodies is of one kind, and the beauty of the
   earthly bodies is of another.

   ^41The sun has one kind of beauty, and the moon another, and the stars
   another; why, one star differs from another in beauty.

   ^42It is so with the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in
   decay, it is raised free from decay.

   ^43It is sown in humiliation, it is raised in splendor. It is sown in
   weakness, it is raised in strength.

   ^44It is a physical body that is sown, it is a spiritual body that is
   raised. If there is a physical body, there is a spiritual body also.

   ^45This is also what the Scripture says: "The first man Adam became a
   living creature." The last Adam has become a life-giving Spirit.

   ^46It is not the spiritual that comes first, but the physical, and then
   the spiritual.

   ^47The first man is of the dust of the earth; the second man is from
   heaven.

   ^48Those who are of the earth are like him who was of the earth, and
   those who are of heaven are like him who is from heaven,

   ^49and as we have been like the man of the earth, let us also try to be
   like the man from heaven.

   ^50But I can tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot share in
   the Kingdom of God, and decay will not share in what is imperishable.

   ^51I will tell you a secret. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall
   all be changed,

   ^52in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the last
   trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised free
   from decay, and we shall be changed.

   ^53For this perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this
   mortal nature must put on immortality.

   ^54And when this mortal nature puts on immortality, then what the
   Scripture says will come true--"Death has been triumphantly destroyed.

   ^55Where, Death, is your victory? Where, Death, is your sting?"

   ^56Sin is the sting of death, and it is the Law that gives sin its
   power.

   ^57But thank God! He gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

   ^58So my dear brothers, be firm and unmoved, and always devote
   yourselves to the Lord's work, for you know that through the Lord your
   labor is not thrown away.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   ^1About the collection for God's people, I want you to do as I told the
   churches of Galatia to do.

   ^2On the first of every week each of you is to put aside and store up
   whatever he gains, so that money will not have to be collected after I
   come.

   ^3When I come I will send whatever persons you authorize with
   credentials, to carry your gift to Jerusalem.

   ^4And if it seems worth while for me to go myself, they can go with me.

   ^5I will come to you after passing through Macedonia, for I am going
   through Macedonia,

   ^6and I will probably stay some time with you, or even pass the winter,
   so that you may start me off for wherever I may be going.

   ^7For I do not want to see you now just in passing, for I hope to spend
   some time with you if the Lord permits it.

   ^8But I shall stay in Ephesus until the Harvest Festival,

   ^9for I have a great and promising opportunity here, as well as many
   opponents.

   ^10If Timothy reaches you, put him at his ease among you, for he is
   devoted to the Lord's work, just as I am.

   ^11So no one is to slight him. But see him off cordially when he comes
   back to me, for I am expecting him with the other brothers.

   ^12As for our brother Apollos, I have often urged him to visit you with
   the other brothers, and he is quite unwilling to come now, but he will
   come when he has a good opportunity.

   ^13Be on the watch. Stand firm in your faith. Act like men. Show
   yourselves strong.

   ^14Do everything with love.

   ^15Now I urge you, brothers--you know that the family of Stephanas was
   the first to be converted in Greece, and that they have devoted
   themselves to the service of God's people--

   ^16I want you to enlist under such leaders, and under anyone who joins
   with you and works hard.

   ^17And I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come
   here, for they have made up for your absence.

   ^18They have cheered my heart, and yours too. You should appreciate
   such men.

   ^19The churches of Asia wish to be remembered to you. Aquila and
   Prisca, with the congregation that meets at their house, send you their
   special Christian greetings.

   ^20All the brothers wish to be remembered to you. Greet one another
   with a sacred kiss.

   ^21This farewell I, Paul, add in my own hand.

   ^22A curse upon anyone who has no love for the Lord. Lord, come
   quickly!

   ^23The blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you!

   ^24My love be with you all through Christ Jesus.

The Second Letter to the Corinthians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, by God's will an apostle of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our
   brother, to the church of God that is at Corinth, and all God's people
   all over Greece;

   ^2God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you
   peace.

   ^3Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the merciful
   Father, and the God always ready to comfort!

   ^4He comforts me in all my trouble, so that I can comfort people who
   are in any trouble with the comfort with which I myself am comforted by
   God.

   ^5For if I have a liberal share of Christ's sufferings, through Christ
   I have a liberal share of comfort too.

   ^6If I am in trouble, it is to bring you comfort and salvation, and if
   I am comforted, it is for the sake of the comfort which you experience
   when you steadfastly endure such sufferings as I also have to bear.

   ^7My hopes for you are unshaken. For I know that just as surely as you
   share my sufferings, just so surely you will share my comfort.

   ^8For I do not want you, brothers, to misunderstand the distress that I
   experienced in Asia, for I was so utterly and unendurably crushed, that
   I actually despaired of life itself.

   ^9Why, I felt in my heart that the end must be death. That was to keep
   me from relying on myself instead of on God, who can even raise the
   dead.

   ^10So deadly was the peril from which he saved me, as he will save me
   again! It is on him that I have set my hope that he will save me again.

   ^11You must help me by your prayers, so that many will give thanks to
   God on my behalf for the blessing granted me in answer to many prayers.

   ^12For my boast is what my conscience tells me, that my relations to
   the world and still more to you have been marked by pure motives and
   godly sincerity, not by worldly shrewdness but by the favor of God.

   ^13For what I am writing to you is only what you can read and
   understand, and I hope that you will understand it fully,

   ^14as some of you have come to understand me, and that you will
   understand that you have a right to be proud of me, as I have of you,
   on the Day of our Lord Jesus.

   ^15It was because I was sure of this that I wanted to come to see you
   before going anywhere else, to give you a double pleasure;

   ^16I was going to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and then to come
   back to you from Macedonia and have you see me off for Judea.

   ^17Was it vacillating of me to want to do that? Do I make my plans like
   a worldly man, ready to say "Yes" and "No" in the same breath?

   ^18As surely as God can be relied on, there has been no equivocation
   about our message to you.

   ^19The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we proclaimed among you,
   Silvanus, Timothy, and I, you have not found wavering between "Yes" and
   "No." With him it has always been "Yes,"

   ^20for to all the promises of God he supplies the "Yes" that confirms
   them. That is why we utter the "Amen" through him, when we give glory
   to God.

   ^21But it is God who guarantees us and you to Christ; he has anointed
   us

   ^22and put his seal upon us and given us his Spirit in our hearts, as
   earnest-money.

   ^23But upon my soul I call God to witness that it is simply to spare
   you that I have stayed away from Corinth.

   ^24Not that we are the masters of you and your faith; we are working
   with you to make you happy, for in your faith you stand firm enough.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1For I made up my mind not to make you another painful visit.

   ^2For if I hurt your feelings, who is there to cheer me up but the man
   whose feelings I hurt?

   ^3This is what I said in my letter, so that I might avoid coming and
   having my feelings hurt by the very people who might have been expected
   to make me happy, for I felt sure about you all, that what made me
   happy would make you all happy.

   ^4For I was in great trouble and distress of mind when I wrote you, and
   I shed many tears as I did it, yet it was not to hurt your feelings,
   but to make you realize the extraordinary affection I have for you.

   ^5But if anyone has hurt anybody's feelings, it is not so much mine, as
   yours, or at least those of some of you, not to be too hard upon you
   all.

   ^6For that individual, this censure by the majority of you is
   punishment enough,

   ^7and so you must now turn around and forgive and comfort him, or he
   may be overwhelmed by his remorse.

   ^8So I beg you to restore him to his place in your affections.

   ^9For that is why I wrote you--to find out how you would stand the
   test, and see if you would obey me absolutely.

   ^10When you forgive a man, I forgive him too. For anything I had to
   forgive has been forgiven on your account, and as in the very presence
   of Christ,

   ^11to keep Satan from getting the better of us. For we know what he is
   after.

   ^12When I went to Troas to preach the good news of the Christ there, I
   found a good opening for the Lord's work,

   ^13but my mind could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus
   there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.

   ^14But thank God! he always leads me in his triumphal train, through
   Christ, and spreads the perfume of knowledge of him everywhere through
   me as his censer-bearer.

   ^15Yes, I am the fragrance of Christ to God, diffused among those who
   are being saved, and those who are perishing alike;

   ^16to the one, a deathly, deadly odor, to the other a vital,
   life-giving one. Who is qualified for this task? I am!

   ^17For I am no peddler of God's message, like most men, but like a man
   of sincerity, commissioned by God and in his presence, in union with
   Christ I utter his message.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Am I falling into self-recommendation again? Do I, like some people,
   need letters of recommendation to you or from you?

   ^2You are my recommendations, written on my heart, for everybody to
   read and understand.

   ^3You show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by me, written
   not in ink, but in the Spirit of the living God, and not on tablets of
   stone, but on the human heart.

   ^4Such is the confidence that I have through Christ in my relations to
   God.

   ^5Not that I am of myself qualified to claim anything as originating
   with me. My qualification is from God,

   ^6and he has qualified me to serve him in the interests of a new
   agreement, not in writing but of spirit. For what is written kills, but
   the Spirit gives life.

   ^7But if the religion of death, carved in letters of stone, was ushered
   in with such splendor, so that the Israelites could not look at Moses'
   face on account of the brightness that was fading from it,

   ^8why should not the religion of the Spirit be attended with much
   greater splendor?

   ^9If there was splendor in the religion of condemnation, the religion
   of uprightness must far surpass it in splendor.

   ^10For in comparison with its surpassing splendor, what was splendid
   has come to have no splendor at all.

   ^11For if what faded away came with splendor, how much more splendid
   what is permanent must be!

   ^12So since I have such a hope, I speak with great frankness,

   ^13not like Moses, who used to wear a veil over his face, to keep the
   Israelites from gazing at the fading of the splendor from it.

   ^14Their minds were dulled. For to this day, that same veil remains
   unlifted, when they read the old agreement, for only through union with
   Christ is it removed.

   ^15Why, to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil hangs over their
   minds,

   ^16but "whenever a man turns to the Lord, the veil is removed."

   ^17Now the Lord here means the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the
   Lord is, there is freedom.

   ^18And all of us, reflecting the splendor of the Lord in our unveiled
   faces, are being changed into likeness to him, from one degree of
   splendor to another, for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1So since by the mercy of God I am engaged in this service, I never
   lose heart.

   ^2I disown disgraceful, underhanded ways. I refuse to practice cunning
   or to tamper with God's message. It is by the open statement of the
   truth that I would commend myself to every human conscience in the
   sight of God.

   ^3If the meaning of my preaching of the good news is veiled at all, it
   is so only in the case of those who are on the way to destruction.

   ^4In their case, the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
   unbelievers, to keep the light of the good news of the glorious Christ,
   the likeness of God, from dawning upon them.

   ^5For it is not myself but Christ Jesus that I am proclaiming as Lord;
   I am only a slave of yours for Jesus' sake.

   ^6For God who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in my
   heart, to give me the light of the knowledge of God's glory, that is on
   the face of Christ.

   ^7But I have this treasure in a mere ear then jar, to show that its
   amazing power belongs to God and not to me.

   ^8I am hard pressed on every side, but never cut off: perplexed, but
   not driven to despair;

   ^9routed, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;

   ^10never free from the danger of being put to death like Jesus, so that
   in my body the life of Jesus also may be seen.

   ^11For every day I live I am being given up to death for Jesus' sake,
   so that the life of Jesus may be visible in my mortal nature.

   ^12So it is death that operates in my case, but life that operates in
   yours.

   ^13In the same spirit of faith as his who said, "I believed, and so I
   spoke," I too believe, and so I speak,

   ^14sure that he who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will raise me
   also like Jesus, and bring me side by side with you into his presence.

   ^15For it is all for your benefit, in order that as God's favor reaches
   greater and greater numbers, it may result in more and more
   thanksgiving in praise of God.

   ^16So I never lose heart. Though my outer nature is wasting away, my
   inner is being renewed every day.

   ^17For this slight, momentary trouble is piling up for me an eternal
   blessedness beyond all comparison,

   ^18because I keep my eyes not on what is seen but what is unseen. For
   what is seen is transitory, but what is unseen is eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1For I know that if this earthly tent that I live in is taken down,
   God will provide me a building in heaven to live in, not built by human
   hands but eternal.

   ^2This makes me sigh with longing to put on my heavenly dwelling,

   ^3for if I do, I shall never find myself disembodied.

   ^4For I who am still in my tent sigh with anxiety, because I do not
   want to be stripped of it, but to put on the other over it, so that
   what is only mortal may be absorbed in life.

   ^5It is God himself who has prepared me for this change, and he has
   given me the Spirit as his guaranty.

   ^6So I am confident. I know well that as long as I am at home in the
   body I am away from the Lord

   ^7(for I have to guide my steps by faith, not by what is seen)--

   ^8yet I am confident, and I prefer to leave my home in the body and
   make my home with the Lord.

   ^9So whether I am at home or away from it, it is my ambition to please
   him.

   ^10For we must all appear in our true characters before the tribunal of
   the Christ, each to be repaid with good or evil for the life he has
   lived in the body.

   ^11It is with this knowledge of what the fear of the Lord means that I
   appeal to men. My true character is perfectly plain to God, and I hope
   to your consciences too.

   ^12I am not trying to recommend myself to you again. I am giving you
   cause to be proud of me, to use in answering men who pride themselves
   on external advantages and not on sincerity of heart.

   ^13For if I was out of my senses, as they say, it was between God and
   me; and if I am in my right mind, it is for your good.

   ^14It is Christ's love that controls me, for I have become convinced
   that as one has died for all, all have died,

   ^15and he died for all that those who live might no longer live for
   themselves, but for him who died for them and rose again.

   ^16So from that time on, I have estimated nobody at what he seemed to
   be outwardly; even though I once estimated Christ in that way, I no
   longer do so.

   ^17So if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being; the old
   state of things has passed away; there is a new state of things.

   ^18All this comes from God, who through Christ has reconciled me to
   himself, and has commissioned me to proclaim this reconciliation--

   ^19how God through Christ reconciled the world to himself, refusing to
   count men's offenses against them, and intrusted me with the message of
   reconciliation.

   ^20It is for Christ, therefore, that I am an envoy, seeing that God
   makes his appeal through me. On Christ's behalf I beg you to be
   reconciled to God.

   ^21He made him who knew nothing of sin to be sin, for our sake, so that
   through union with him we might become God's uprightness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1As God's fellow-worker, I appeal to you, too, not to accept the favor
   of God and then waste it.

   ^2For he says,

   "I have listened to you at a welcome time,

   And helped you on a day of deliverance!"

   Now the welcome time has come! This is the day of deliverance!

   ^3I put no obstacles in anyone's path, so that no fault may be found
   with my work.

   ^4On the contrary, as a servant of God I try in every way to commend
   myself to them, through my great endurance in troubles, difficulties,
   hardships,

   ^5beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, and hunger,

   ^6through my purity of life, my knowledge, my patience, my kindness, my
   holiness of spirit, my genuine love,

   ^7the truth of my teaching, and the power of God; with the weapons of
   uprightness for the right hand and the left,

   ^8in honor or dishonor, in praise or blame; considered an imposter,
   when I am true,

   ^9obscure, when I am well known, at the point of death, yet here I am
   alive, punished, but not dead yet,

   ^10pained, when I am always glad, poor, when I make many others rich,
   penniless, when really I own everything.

   ^11I have kept nothing back from you, men of Corinth; I have opened my
   heart to you.

   ^12It is not that I am cramping you, it is your own affections.

   ^13To pay me back, I tell you, my children, you must open your hearts
   too.

   ^14Do not get into close and incongruous relations with unbelievers.
   What partnership can uprightness have with iniquity, or what can light
   have to do with darkness?

   ^15How can Christ agree with Belial? Or what has a believer in common
   with an unbeliever?

   ^16What bargain can a temple of God make with idols? For we are a
   temple of the living God, just as God said,

   "I will live in them and move among them,

   And I will be their God and they will be my people."

   ^17Therefore,

   "Come out from them,

   And separate from them, says the Lord,

   And touch nothing that is unclean.

   Then I will welcome you,

   ^18I will become a father to you,

   And you shall become my sons and daughters,

   Says the Lord Almighty."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1So since we have promises like these, dear friends, let us cleanse
   ourselves of everything that can defile body or spirit, and by
   reverence for God make our consecration complete.

   ^2Make room for me in your hearts. I have not wronged or harmed or got
   the better of anybody.

   ^3I do not mean this as a reflection upon you, for as I said before,
   you will always have a place in my heart whether I live or die.

   ^4I have the greatest confidence in you. I take the greatest pride in
   you. I am fully comforted. After all my trouble, I am overjoyed.

   ^5For even when I reached Macedonia, my poor human nature could get no
   relief--there was trouble at every turn; fighting without, and fear
   within.

   ^6But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted me by the coming of
   Titus,

   ^7and not only by his coming, but by the comfort you had given him, for
   he told me how you longed to see me, how sorry you were, and how you
   took my part, which made me happier still.

   ^8For even if I did hurt your feelings with that letter, I cannot
   regret it; even if I did regret it, when I saw that the letter had hurt
   your feelings perhaps for a while,

   ^9I am glad of it now; not because you had your feelings hurt, but
   because having them hurt led you to repent, for you took it as God
   meant you to do, so that you should not lose anything at all through
   me.

   ^10For the pain that God approves results in a repentance that leads to
   salvation and leaves no regrets; but the world's pain results in death.

   ^11See how earnest this God-given pain has made you! how eager to clear
   yourselves, how indignant, how alarmed, how eager to see me, how
   zealous, how avenging! At every point you have proved that you are
   clear of this matter.

   ^12So although I did write to you, it was not on account of the
   offender, nor of the injured man, but in the sight of God to reveal to
   you your devotion to me.

   ^13That is why I am so comforted.

   With all my own comfort, I was still more overjoyed at the gladness of
   Titus, for his mind has been set at rest by you all.

   ^14If I did express some pride in you to him, I have had no reason to
   be ashamed of it, but just as all I said to you was true, my boasting
   before Titus has also proved true.

   ^15His heart goes out all the more to you, as he recalls how you all
   obeyed him, and with what reverence and trembling you received him.

   ^16I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1I must tell you, brothers, how the favor of God has been shown in the
   churches of Macedonia,

   ^2for in spite of a severe ordeal of trouble, their extraordinary
   gladness, combined with their extreme poverty, has overflowed in a
   wealth of generosity.

   ^3For they have given to the utmost of their ability, as I can bear
   them witness, and beyond it,

   ^4and begged me most earnestly, of their own accord, to let them share
   in the support of their fellow-Christians.

   ^5They did far more than I hoped, for first in obedience to God's will,
   they gave themselves to the Lord, and to me.

   ^6This has led me to urge Titus to complete the arrangements he had
   formerly begun among you for this gracious undertaking.

   ^7Just as you excel in everything else--faith, expression, knowledge,
   perfect devotion, and the love we have awakened in you--you must excel
   in this generous undertaking too.

   ^8I do not mean this as a command. I only want to test the genuineness
   of your love by the devotion of others.

   ^9You know how gracious the Lord Jesus Christ was. Though he was rich,
   he became poor for your sake, in order that by his poverty you might
   become rich.

   ^10But I will tell you what I think about it. For this is the best way
   to deal with you, for you were the first not only to do anything about
   this, but to want to do anything, and that was last year.

   ^11Now finish doing it, so that your readiness to undertake it may be
   equaled by the way you finish it up, as well as your means permit.

   ^12If a man is willing to give, the value of his gift is in its
   proportion to what he has, not to what he has not.

   ^13I do not mean to be easy upon others and hard upon you,

   ^14but to equalize the burden, and in the present situation to have
   your plenty make up for what they need, so that some day their plenty
   may make up for what you need, and so things may be made equal--

   ^15as the Scripture says, "The man who got much did not have too much,
   and the man who got little did not have too little."

   ^16Thank God, he puts the same devotion to you that I feel into Titus'
   heart,

   ^17for he has responded to my appeal, but he goes to you really of his
   own accord, he is so devoted to you.

   ^18I am sending with him his brother, who is famous in all the churches
   for his work in spreading the good news.

   ^19What is more, he has been appointed by the churches to travel with
   me in the interests of this generous undertaking, which I am
   superintending to honor the Lord and to show our readiness to help.

   ^20I mean to have no one able to find any fault with the way I handle
   this munificence.

   ^21I intend to do what is right not only in the Lord's sight but in the
   eyes of men.

   ^22I send with them another brother of ours whose devotion we have
   often tested in many ways, which is now greater than ever, because of
   his perfect confidence in you.

   ^23So as far as Titus is concerned, he is my partner and comrade in my
   work for you, while these brothers of ours represent the churches, and
   are a credit to Christ.

   ^24So you must give proof to them before all the churches of your love,
   and justify my pride in you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   ^1It is really unnecessary for me to write to you about this fund for
   your fellow-Christians,

   ^2for I know how willing you are to help in it; I boast of you for it
   to the people in Macedonia, telling them that Greece has been ready
   since last year, and your enthusiasm has been a stimulus to most of
   them.

   ^3But I send the brothers so that our pride in you may not have a fall
   in this matter, but you may be all ready as I have told them you will;

   ^4for if some people from Macedonia come with me, and find that you are
   not ready, it will humiliate me--to say nothing of you--for having
   expressed such confidence.

   ^5So I have thought it necessary to ask these brothers to go on to you
   ahead of me, to arrange in advance for this gift you have promised, so
   as to have it ready, like an expression of your good will, not of your
   avarice.

   ^6Remember this: The man who sows sparingly will reap sparingly, and
   the man who sows generously will reap generously.

   ^7Everyone must give what he has made up his mind to give, not
   reluctantly or under compulsion; God loves a man who is glad to give.

   ^8God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance so that
   you will always have enough for every situation, and ample means for
   every good enterprise:

   ^9as the Scripture says,

   "He scatters his gifts to the poor;

   His uprightness will never be forgotten."

   ^10He who supplies the sower with seed and so with bread to eat will
   supply you with seed, and multiply it and enlarge the harvest of your
   uprightness.

   ^11You will grow rich in every way, so that through me you can show
   perfect liberality that will make men thank God for it.

   ^12For the rendering of this service does more than supply the wants of
   God's people; it results in a wealth of thanksgiving to God.

   ^13The way you stand the test of this service must do honor to God,
   through your fidelity to what you profess as to the good news of
   Christ, and through the liberality of your contributions for them and
   for all others;

   ^14then they will long for you and pray for you, because of the
   extraordinary favor God has shown you.

   ^15Thank God for his indescribable gift!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1I appeal to you personally, by the gentleness and forbearance of
   Christ--the Paul who is so humble when face to face with you, but so
   bold in dealing with you when he is far away!

   ^2I beg you not to make me take as bold an attitude when I come, as I
   count on taking toward some people who suspect me of acting from
   worldly motives.

   ^3For though I do live an earthly life, I am not carrying on an earthly
   war,

   ^4for the weapons I use are not earthly ones, but divinely strong for
   destroying fortresses.

   ^5I destroy arguments and every obstacle that is raised against the
   knowledge of God, and I take captive every thought and make it obey
   Christ,

   ^6and am prepared to punish any trace of disobedience when you have
   made your obedience perfectly clear.

   ^7You look at things externally. If anyone is sure he belongs to
   Christ, let him think again and understand that I belong to Christ just
   as much as he.

   ^8For suppose I do boast a little too much of my authority--which the
   Lord gave me to build you up, not to pull you down--I will not have to
   blush for it.

   ^9I do not want to seem to scare you with my letters.

   ^10For they say, "His letters are impressive and telling, but his
   personal appearance is insignificant and as a speaker he amounts to
   nothing."

   ^11Such people had better understand that when I arrive and take action
   I will do just as I say I will in my letters when I am far away.

   ^12I do not indeed venture to class or compare myself with certain
   individuals who approve of themselves. But when they measure themselves
   by one another and compare themselves with one another, they do not
   show good sense.

   ^13But my boasting will not be extravagant, nor exceed the limits God
   has allowed me, which reach all the way to you.

   ^14It is no strain for me to do this, as it might be for people who had
   never got so far, for I was the first to come all the way to you with
   the good news of the Christ.

   ^15I do not indulge in extravagant boasts over work done by others, but
   I do hope that as your faith increases, my influence may be immensely
   enlarged through you,

   ^16and I may preach the gospel in the lands beyond you without having
   to boast over work already done in another's field.

   ^17But let the man who boasts, boast about the Lord.

   ^18For it is not the man who approves of himself who is really
   approved; it is the man of whom the Lord approves.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1I wish you would put up with a little folly from me. Do put up with
   it!

   ^2I feel a divine jealousy about you, for I betrothed you to Christ, to
   present you as a pure bride to her one husband.

   ^3But I am afraid that just as the serpent by his cunning deceived Eve,
   your thoughts will be led astray from their single-hearted fidelity to
   Christ.

   ^4For when somebody comes along and preaches another Jesus than the one
   I preached, or you receive a different spirit from the one you received
   or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it
   well enough!

   ^5For I think that I am not in the least inferior to these superfine
   apostles of yours.

   ^6Even if I have no particular gifts in speaking, I am not wanting in
   knowledge. Why, I have always made that perfectly clear in my dealings
   with you.

   ^7Do you think that I did wrong in degrading myself to uplift you,
   because I preached God's good news to you without any compensation?

   ^8I robbed other churches, letting them pay me so that I could work for
   you!

   ^9And when I was with you and wanted money, I did not burden any of
   you, for when the brothers came from Macedonia they supplied what I
   needed. So I kept myself, as I shall always do, from being a burden to
   you in any way.

   ^10By the truth of Christ that is in me, this boast of mine shall not
   be silenced anywhere in Greece.

   ^11And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do.

   ^12And I shall go on doing as I do, so as to cut the ground from under
   those who want to make out that in their boasted apostleship they work
   on the same terms that I do.

   ^13Such men are sham apostles, dishonest workmen, masquerading as
   apostles of Christ.

   ^14And no wonder, for even Satan himself masquerades as a shining
   angel.

   ^15So it is nothing strange if his servants also masquerade as servants
   of uprightness. But their doom will fit their actions.

   ^16I repeat, no one should think me a fool, but if you do, show me at
   least the patience you would show a fool, and let me have my little
   boast like the others.

   ^17When I boast in this reckless way, I do not say what I am saying for
   the Lord, but as a fool would talk.

   ^18Since many are so human as to boast, I will do it also.

   ^19For you like to put up with fools, you are so wise yourselves!

   ^20For you put up with it if a man makes you his slaves, or lives on
   you, or takes you in, or puts on airs, or gives you a slap in the face.

   ^21To my shame I must admit that I was too weak for that sort of thing.
   But whatever anyone else dares to boast of--I am playing the part of a
   fool--I will dare to boast of too.

   ^22If they are Hebrews, so am I! If they are Israelites, so am I! If
   they are descended from Abraham, so am I!

   ^23If they are Christian workers--I am talking like a madman!--I am a
   better one! with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, vastly
   worse beatings, and in frequent danger of death.

   ^24Five times I have been given one less than forty lashes, by the
   Jews.

   ^25I have been beaten three times by the Romans, I have been stoned
   once, I have been shipwrecked three times, a night and a day I have
   been adrift at sea;

   ^26with my frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from
   robbers, danger from my own people, danger from the heathen, danger in
   the city, danger in the desert, danger at sea, danger from false
   brothers,

   ^27through toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, through
   hunger and thirst, often without food, and exposed to cold.

   ^28And besides everything else, the thing that burdens me every day is
   my anxiety about all the churches.

   ^29Who is weak without my being weak? Whose conscience is hurt without
   my being fired with indignation?

   ^30If there must be boasting, I will boast of the things that show my
   weakness!

   ^31The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is forever
   blessed, knows that I am telling the truth.

   ^32When I was at Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had the city
   gates watched in order to catch me,

   ^33but I was lowered in a basket from an opening in the wall, and got
   out of his clutches.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1I have to boast. There is nothing to be gained by it, but I will go
   on to visions and revelations given me by the Lord.

   ^2I know of a man fourteen years ago--whether in the body or out of it,
   I do not know, God knows--being actually caught up to the third heaven.

   ^3And I know that this man--I do not know whether it was in the body or
   out of it, God knows--

   ^4was caught up into Paradise, and heard things that must not be told,
   which no human being can repeat.

   ^5On this man's account I am ready to boast, but about myself I will
   boast only of my weaknesses.

   ^6Though if I do choose to boast, I will not be such a fool, for I will
   only be telling the truth. But I will refrain from it, for I do not
   want anyone to be influenced by the wonderful character of these
   revelations to think more of me than is justified by my words or
   conduct.

   ^7So to keep me from being too much elated a bitter physical affliction
   was sent to me, a very messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me
   from being too much elated.

   ^8Three times I have prayed to the Lord about this, begging that it
   might leave me,

   ^9and he said to me, "My favor is enough for you, for only where there
   is weakness is perfect strength developed."

   So I am perfectly willing to boast of all my weakness, so that the
   strength of Christ may shelter me.

   ^10That is why I am pleased with weaknesses, insults, hardships,
   persecutions, and difficulties, when they are endured for Christ's
   sake, for it is when I am weak that I am strong.

   ^11I have been making a fool of myself, but you forced me to do it,
   when you ought to have been expressing your approval of me. For I am
   not a bit inferior to your superfine apostles, even if I am nobody!

   ^12The signs that mark a true apostle were most patiently shown when I
   was among you, in signs, wonders, and marvels.

   ^13For what is there in which the other churches had the better of you,
   except in the fact that I would not permit myself to be a burden to
   you? You must forgive me that wrong!

   ^14Here it is the third time that I have been ready to come to see you,
   and I do not intend to be a burden to you now; for it is not your money
   but yourselves that I want; for children are not expected to lay up
   money for their parents, but parents for their children.

   ^15And I will be glad to spend all I have and all I am for your sake.
   Are you going to love me the less for loving you so intensely?

   ^16But granting that I did not burden you myself, I was clever about
   it, you say, and took you in by a trick.

   ^17Yet did I make anything out of you by anybody that I sent to you?

   ^18I asked Titus to go and I sent his brother with him. Did Titus make
   anything out of you? Did not he and I act in the same spirit, and take
   the very same steps?

   ^19Have you been supposing all along that it is before you I have been
   defending myself? It is in the sight of God and as a follower of Christ
   that I have been speaking. But it is all to do you good, dear friends,

   ^20for I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I
   want to find you, and that you may find me not as you want to find me.
   I am afraid that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, bad
   feeling, rivalry, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder,

   ^21and that when I come back my God may humiliate me before you, and I
   may have to mourn over many who have kept on in their old sins and have
   never repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality in which
   they have indulged.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   ^1This will be my third visit to you. Any charge must be sustained by
   the evidence of two or three witnesses.

   ^2Those who have kept on in their old sins and all the rest I have
   warned, and I warn them now while I am still away, as I did on my
   second visit, that if I come back I will spare nobody--

   ^3since you demand proof that Christ really speaks through me. He is
   not weak in dealing with you. On the contrary, right among you he
   exhibits his power.

   ^4Even if he was crucified through weakness, by the power of God he is
   alive. For we are weak as he was, but you will find that by the power
   of God we will be alive as he is.

   ^5It is yourselves you must test, to see whether you are holding to the
   faith. It is yourselves you must examine. Do you not know that Jesus
   Christ is within you? Unless you fail to stand the test!

   ^6I hope you will see that I do not fail to stand it.

   ^7But I pray to God that you may not do wrong--not to prove me equal to
   the test, but that you should do right even if I fail to stand it.

   ^8For I cannot do anything against the truth, but only for it.

   ^9I am glad to be weak, if you are strong! That is what I pray for--the
   perfecting of your characters.

   ^10That is why I write this while I am away from you, so that when I
   come, I may not have to be harsh in my use of the authority the Lord
   has given me, for it was to build you up, not to pull you down.

   ^11Now brothers, goodbye! Be what you ought to be, listen to my appeal,
   agree with one another, live in peace, and God the source of love and
   peace will be with you.

   ^12Greet one another with a sacred kiss.

   ^13All God's people wish to be remembered to you.

   ^14The blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the
   participation in the holy Spirit be with you all.

The Letter to the Galatians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, an apostle not from men nor sent by any man, but by Jesus
   Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead--

   ^2and all the brothers who are here with me, to the churches of
   Galatia;

   ^3blessing and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
   Christ,

   ^4who to save us from the present wicked world gave himself for our
   sins at the will of our God and Father.

   ^5To him be glory forever and ever! Amen.

   ^6I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from him who called
   you by the mercy of Christ, to some different good news--

   ^7not that there is any other, only that there are some people who are
   trying to unsettle you and want to turn the good news of the Christ
   around.

   ^8But even if we or an angel from heaven preach to you good news that
   contradicts the good news we have preached to you, a curse upon him!

   ^9We have said it before, and I repeat it now--if anyone is preaching
   to you good news that contradicts the good news you have already
   received, a curse upon him!

   ^10Is that appealing to men's weaknesses, or to God? Is that trying to
   suit men? If I were still doing that, I would be no slave of Christ.

   ^11For I tell you plainly, brothers, that the good news that I preached
   is not a human affair.

   ^12I did not receive it from any man, and I was not taught it, but it
   came to me through a revelation of Jesus Christ.

   ^13You have heard of my former conduct when I was attached to the
   Jewish religion--how furiously I used to persecute the church of God
   and ravage it,

   ^14and how I surpassed many of my own age among my people in my
   devotion to Judaism, I was so fanatically devoted to what my
   forefathers had handed down.

   ^15And when God, who had set me apart from my birth and had called me
   in his mercy, saw fit

   ^16to reveal his Son to me, so that I might preach the good news about
   him to the heathen, immediately, instead of consulting with any human
   being,

   ^17or going up to Jerusalem to see those who had been apostles before
   me, I went off to Arabia, and on my return came back to Damascus.

   ^18Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem, to become acquainted
   with Cephas, and I spent two weeks with him;

   ^19but I did not see any other apostle, except James, the Lord's
   brother.

   ^20(In writing you this, I call God to witness that I am telling the
   truth!)

   ^21After that, I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.

   ^22I was still personally unknown to the Christian churches of Judea;

   ^23they only heard people say, "The man who once persecuted us is now
   preaching the good news of the faith he tried to destroy,"

   ^24and they praised God for me.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1Then, fourteen years later, I went up to Jerusalem again, with
   Barnabas, and took Titus also with me.

   ^2It was in obedience to a revelation that I went. I laid before them
   the good news that I preach to the heathen, presenting it privately to
   the leaders, for fear my efforts might be or might have been futile.

   ^3But they did not insist that even my companion Titus, although he was
   a Greek, should be circumcised,

   ^4to gratify the false brothers who had been smuggled in, who sneaked
   in to spy upon the freedom we enjoy in Christ Jesus, so as to reduce us
   to slavery again.

   ^5But we did not submit to them for a moment, in order that the truth
   of the good news might remain yours.

   ^6Those who were regarded as the leaders--what they once were makes no
   difference to me; God takes no account of external differences--the
   leaders contributed nothing new to me.

   ^7On the contrary, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the
   good news for the heathen, just as Peter had been intrusted with it for
   the Jews--

   ^8for he who actuated Peter to be an apostle to the Jews also actuated
   me to be one to the heathen--

   ^9and when they recognized the favor God had shown me, James, Cephas,
   and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, pledged Barnabas
   and me their co-operation, with the understanding that we should work
   among the heathen and they among the Jews.

   ^10Only, we were to remember the poor, and that I have taken pains to
   do.

   ^11But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, for his
   own conduct condemned him.

   ^12For until some people came from James, he used to eat with the
   heathen, but after they came, he began to draw back and hold aloof, for
   fear of the party of circumcision.

   ^13The other Jewish Christians followed his example in concealing their
   real views, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their pose.

   ^14But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of
   the good news, I said to Cephas, right before them all, "If you live
   like a heathen, and not like a Jew, though you are a Jew yourself, why
   should you try to make the heathen live like Jews?"

   ^15We who are Jews by birth, and not sinful heathen,

   ^16but who know that a man is not made upright by doing what the Law
   commands, but by faith in Christ Jesus--even we believed in Christ
   Jesus, so as to be made upright by faith in Christ and not by doing
   what the Law commands--for by doing what the Law commands no one can be
   made upright.

   ^17If through our efforts to be made upright through Christ, we have
   ourselves been proved as much "sinners" as the heathen, does that make
   Christ encourage sin? By no means.

   ^18I really convict myself of wrongdoing when I start to rebuild what I
   tore down.

   ^19For it is through the Law that I have become dead to the Law, so
   that I may live for God.

   ^20I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live,
   but Christ that lives in me. The life I am now living in the body I am
   living by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.

   ^21I refuse to nullify the mercy of God. For if uprightness could be
   secured through law, then Christ died for nothing!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1You senseless Galatians! Who has bewitched you, when you had Jesus
   Christ shown crucified right before your eyes?

   ^2This is all I want to ask you: Did you receive the Spirit through
   doing what the Law commands, or through believing the message you
   heard?

   ^3Are you so senseless? Did you begin with the Spirit only to end now
   with the flesh?

   ^4Have you gone through so much, all for nothing?--if it really is for
   nothing!

   ^5When he supplies you with the Spirit and works wonders among you, is
   it because you do what the Law commands, or because you believe the
   message you heard?

   ^6Just as Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him as
   uprightness.

   ^7So you see, the real descendants of Abraham are the men of faith.

   ^8The Scripture foresaw that God would accept the heathen as upright in
   consequence of their faith, and preached the good news in advance to
   Abraham in the words, "All the heathen will be blessed through you."

   ^9So the men of faith share the blessing of Abraham and his faith.

   ^10For there is a curse upon all who rely on obedience to the Law, for
   the Scripture says, "Cursed be anyone who does not stand by everything
   that is written in the Book of the Law and obey it."

   ^11That no one is accepted as upright by God for obeying the Law is
   evident because the upright will have life because of his faith,

   ^12and the Law has nothing to do with faith; it teaches that it is the
   man who does these things that will find life by doing them.

   ^13Christ ransomed us from the Law's curse by taking our curse upon
   himself (for the Scripture says, "Cursed be anyone who is hung on a
   tree")

   ^14in order that the blessing given to Abraham might through Jesus
   Christ reach the heathen, so that through faith we might receive the
   promised Spirit.

   ^15To take an illustration, brothers, from daily life: even a human
   agreement, once ratified, no one annuls or alters.

   ^16Now the promises were made to Abraham and his line. It does not say,
   "and to your lines," in the plural, but in the singular, "and to your
   line," that is, Christ.

   ^17My point is this: An agreement already ratified by God cannot be
   annulled and its promise canceled by the Law, which arose four hundred
   and thirty years later.

   ^18If our inheritance rests on the Law, it has nothing to do with the
   promise. Yet it was as a promise that God bestowed it upon Abraham.

   ^19Then what about the Law? It was a later addition, designed to
   produce transgressions, until the descendant to which the promise was
   made should come, and it was enacted by means of angels, through an
   intermediary;

   ^20though an intermediary implies more than one party, while God is but
   one.

   ^21Is the Law then contrary to God's promises? By no means. For if a
   law had been given that could have brought life, uprightness would
   really have come through law.

   ^22But the Scripture describes all mankind as the prisoners of sin, so
   that the promised blessing might on the ground of faith in Jesus Christ
   be given to those who have faith.

   ^23But before this faith came, we were kept shut up under the Law, in
   order to obtain the faith that was to be revealed.

   ^24So the Law has been our attendant on our way to Christ, so that we
   might be made upright through faith.

   ^25But now that faith has come, we are no longer in the charge of the
   attendant.

   ^26For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through your faith.

   ^27For all of you who have been baptized into union with Christ have
   clothed yourselves with Christ.

   ^28There is no room for "Jew" and "Greek"; there is no room for "slave"
   and "freeman"; there is no room for "male" and "female"; for in union
   with Christ Jesus you are all one.

   ^29And if you belong to Christ, then you are true descendants of
   Abraham and his heirs under the promise.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1I mean this: As long as the heir is a minor, he is no better than a
   slave, although he is the owner of all the property,

   ^2but he is under guardians and trustees until the time fixed by his
   father.

   ^3So when we were minors, we were slaves to material ways of looking at
   things,

   ^4but when the proper time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, and
   made subject to law,

   ^5to ransom those who were subject to law, so that we might receive
   adoption.

   ^6And because you are sons, God has sent into our hearts the spirit of
   his Son, with the cry, "Abba!" that is, Father.

   ^7So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir,
   made so by God.

   ^8But formerly, in your ignorance of God, you were slaves to gods that
   really did not exist,

   ^9but now that you know God, or rather have come to be known by him,
   how can you turn back to the old, crude notions, so poor and weak, and
   wish to become slaves to them again?

   ^10You are observing days, months, seasons, and years!

   ^11I begin to be afraid that perhaps the labor I spent on you was
   wasted.

   ^12Take my position, I beg you, brothers, just as I once took yours!
   You took no advantage of me then;

   ^13though you know that it was because of an illness that I preached
   the good news to you that first time;

   ^14and yet what must have tried you in my physical condition, you did
   not scorn and despise, but you welcomed me like an angel of God, like
   Christ Jesus himself.

   ^15What has become of that satisfaction of yours? For I can bear
   witness that you would have torn out your very eyes, if you could, and
   given them to me!

   ^16Have I turned into an enemy to you, by telling you the truth?

   ^17These men are making much of you, but not with honorable intentions.
   They want to shut you out, so that you will have to make much of them.

   ^18But it is a finer thing to be made much of honestly and
   constantly--not just when I can be with you,

   ^19my children--you for whom I am enduring a mother's pains again,
   until Christ is formed in you.

   ^20I wish I could be with you now, and use a different tone with you,
   for I do not know which way to turn about you.

   ^21Tell me this, you who want to be subject to law: Will you not listen
   to the Law?

   ^22For the Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one by the
   slave-girl, and one by the free woman.

   ^23But the child of the slave-girl was born in the ordinary course of
   nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfilment of the
   promise.

   ^24This is an allegorical utterance. For the women are two agreements,
   one coming from Mount Sinai, bearing children that are to be slaves;
   that is, Hagar

   ^25(and Hagar means Mount Sinai, in Arabia), and corresponds to the
   present Jerusalem, for Jerusalem is in slavery with her children.

   ^26But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.

   ^27For the Scripture says,

   "Rejoice, childless woman, who bear no children,

   Break into shouting, you who have no birth pains!

   For the desolate woman has more children than the married one!"

   ^28Now we, brothers, are like Isaac, children born in fulfilment of the
   promise.

   ^29But just as then the child born in the ordinary course of nature
   persecuted the one born through the influence of the Spirit, so it is
   today.

   ^30Yet what does the Scripture say? "Drive the slave-girl and her son
   away, for the slave-girl's son shall not share the inheritance with the
   son of the free woman."

   ^31So, brothers, we are children not of a slave but of one who is free.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1This is the freedom with which Christ has freed us. So stand firm in
   it, and do not get under a yoke of slavery again.

   ^2Why, I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised,
   Christ can do nothing for you.

   ^3I insist again to any man who lets himself be circumcised, that he is
   under obligation to obey the whole Law.

   ^4You people who propose to be made upright by law have finished with
   Christ; you have lost your hold upon God's favor.

   ^5But we, by the Spirit, through faith wait for the uprightness we hope
   for.

   ^6For in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor the want of
   it counts for anything, but only faith acting through love.

   ^7You were making such progress! Who has stopped your obeying the
   truth?

   ^8That kind of persuasion never came from him who called you!

   ^9A little yeast will make all the dough rise.

   ^10I am confident in the Lord that you will not take a different view.
   The man who is unsettling you will have to pay the penalty for it, no
   matter who he is.

   ^11And I, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I
   still being persecuted? If that is the case, the cross has ceased to be
   an obstacle, I suppose!

   ^12I wish the people who are upsetting you would go on, and have
   themselves emasculated!

   ^13For you, brothers, have been called to freedom; only do not make
   your freedom an excuse for the physical, but in love be slaves to one
   another.

   ^14For the whole Law is summed up in one saying: "You must love your
   neighbor as you do yourself."

   ^15But if you bite one another and eat one another, take care, or you
   will be destroyed by one another.

   ^16I mean this: Live by the Spirit, and then you will not indulge your
   physical cravings.

   ^17For the physical cravings are against the Spirit, and the cravings
   of the Spirit are against the physical; the two are in opposition, so
   that you cannot do anything you please.

   ^18But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not subject to law.

   ^19The things our physical nature does are clear enough--immorality,
   impurity, licentiousness,

   ^20idolatry, sorcery, enmity, quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness,
   dissension, party-spirit,

   ^21envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you as I did
   before that people who do such things will have no share in the Kingdom
   of God.

   ^22But what the Spirit produces is love, joy, peace, patience,
   kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

   ^23gentleness, self-control. There is no law against such things!

   ^24Those who belong to Jesus the Christ have crucified the physical
   nature with its propensities and cravings.

   ^25If we live by the Spirit, let us be guided by the Spirit.

   ^26Let us not in our vanity challenge one another or envy one another.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1But if a man is caught doing something wrong, brothers, you are
   spiritual, and you must set him right, in a spirit of gentleness. Think
   of yourself, for you may be tempted too.

   ^2Bear one another's burdens, and in that way carry out the law of the
   Christ.

   ^3For if anyone thinks he is somebody when he is really nobody, he is
   deceiving himself.

   ^4Every man ought to test his own work, and then whatever satisfaction
   he has will be with reference to himself, and not in comparison with
   someone else.

   ^5For everyone will have to carry his own load.

   ^6Those who are taught the message must share all their goods with
   their teacher.

   ^7Do not be deceived. God is not to be sneered at. A man will reap just
   what he sows.

   ^8The man who sows to gratify his physical cravings will reap
   destruction from them, and the man who sows to benefit the spirit will
   reap eternal life from the Spirit.

   ^9Let us not get tired of doing right, for at the proper time we shall
   reap, if we do not give out.

   ^10So then whenever we have an opportunity, let us do good to all men,
   especially to those who belong to the family of the faith.

   ^11See what large letters I make, when I write to you with my own hand!

   ^12These men who are trying to force you to let yourselves be
   circumcised want to present a good appearance externally, to save
   themselves from having to stand persecution for the cross of Jesus the
   Christ.

   ^13Why, even those who let themselves be circumcised do not observe the
   Law themselves! But they want you to let yourselves be circumcised so
   that they can boast of that physical fact about you!

   ^14But I never want to boast of anything but the cross of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, on which the world has been crucified to me and I have
   been to the world.

   ^15For neither circumcision nor the want of it is of any importance,
   but only a new creation.

   ^16Peace and mercy be on all who will follow this rule, and on the true
   Israel of God.

   ^17Let nobody interfere with me after this, for I bear on my body the
   scars that mark me as a slave of Jesus.

   ^18The blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
   Amen.

The Letter to the Ephesians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, by God's will an apostle of Christ Jesus, to God's people who
   are steadfast in Christ Jesus;

   ^2God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you
   peace.

   ^3Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who through
   Christ has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
   realm.

   ^4Through him he chose us out before the creation of the world, to be
   consecrated and above reproach in his sight in love.

   ^5He foreordained us to become his sons through Jesus Christ, in
   fulfilment of his generous purpose,

   ^6so that we might praise the splendid blessing which he has given us
   through his beloved Son.

   ^7It is through union with him and through his blood that we have been
   delivered and our offenses forgiven,

   ^8in the abundance of his mercy which he has lavished upon us.

   ^9He has given us perfect insight into his secret purpose and
   understanding of it, in following out the design he planned to carry
   out in Christ,

   ^10and in arranging, when the time should have fully come, that
   everything in heaven and on earth should be unified in Christ--

   ^11the Christ through whom it is our lot to have been predestined by
   the design of him who in everything carries out the purpose of his
   will,

   ^12to win praise for his glory, by having been the first to believe in
   Christ.

   ^13You also have heard the message of the truth, the good news of your
   salvation, and believed in him, and through union with him you have
   been marked with the seal of the holy Spirit that was promised,

   ^14which is the advance installment of our inheritance, so that we may
   get full possession of it, and praise his glory for it.

   ^15This is why I, for my part, since I have heard of the faith in the
   Lord Jesus that prevails among you and among all God's people,

   ^16never cease to thank God for you when I mention you in my prayers.

   ^17The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, grant you the
   Spirit of wisdom and revelation through the knowledge of himself,

   ^18enlightening the eyes of your mind so that you may know what the
   hope is to which he calls you, and how gloriously rich his inheritance
   is among God's people,

   ^19and how surpassingly great his power is for us who believe; like the
   mighty strength

   ^20he exerted in raising Christ from the dead, and seating him at his
   right hand in heaven,

   ^21far above all hierarchies, authorities, powers, and dominions, and
   all titles that can be bestowed not only in this world but in the world
   to come.

   ^22He has put everything under his feet and made him the indisputable
   head of the church,

   ^23which is his body, filled by him who fills everything everywhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1You also were dead because of the offenses and sins

   ^2in the midst of which you once lived under the control of the present
   age of the world, and the master-spirit of the air, who is still at
   work among the disobedient.

   ^3We all lived among them once, indulging our physical cravings and
   obeying the impulses of our lower nature and its thoughts, and by
   nature we were doomed to God's wrath like other men.

   ^4But God is so rich in mercy that because of the great love he had for
   us,

   ^5he made us, dead as we were through our offenses, live again with the
   Christ. It is by his mercy that you have been saved.

   ^6And he raised us with Christ, and through our union with Christ Jesus
   made us sit down with him in heaven,

   ^7to show the incomparable wealth of his mercy throughout the ages to
   come by his goodness to us through Christ Jesus.

   ^8For it is by his mercy that you have been saved through faith. It is
   not by your own action, it is the gift of God.

   ^9It has not been earned, so that no one can boast of it.

   ^10For he has made us, creating us through our union with Christ Jesus
   for the life of goodness which God had predestined us to live.

   ^11So remember that you were once physically heathen, and called
   uncircumcised by those who called themselves circumcised, though only
   physically, by human hands.

   ^12At that time you had no connection with Christ, you were aliens to
   the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the agreements about God's
   promise; with no hope and no God in all the world.

   ^13But now through your union with Christ Jesus you who were once far
   away have through the blood of Christ been brought near.

   ^14For he is himself our peace. He has united the two divisions, and
   broken down the barrier that kept us apart,

   ^15and through his human nature put an end to the feud between us, and
   abolished the Law with its rules and regulations, in order to make
   peace and create out of the two parties one new man by uniting them
   with himself,

   ^16and to kill the feud between them with his cross and in one body
   reconcile them both to God with it.

   ^17He came with the good news of peace for you who were far away and
   for those who were near;

   ^18for it is through him that we both with one Spirit are now able to
   approach the Father.

   ^19So you are no longer foreigners or strangers, but you are
   fellow-citizens of God's people and members of his family.

   ^20You are built upon the apostles and prophets as your foundation, and
   Christ Jesus himself is the cornerstone.

   ^21Through him every part of the building is closely united and grows
   into a temple sacred through its relation to the Lord,

   ^22and you are yourselves built up into a dwelling for God through the
   Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1This is why I, Paul, whom Jesus the Christ has made a prisoner for
   the sake of you heathen--

   ^2if at least you have heard how I dealt with the mercy of God that was
   given me for you,

   ^3and how the secret was made known to me by revelation, as I have just
   briefly written.

   ^4As you read that, you will be able to understand the insight I have
   into the secret of the Christ

   ^5(which in past ages was not disclosed to mankind as fully as it has
   now been revealed through the Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets)

   ^6that through union with Christ Jesus the heathen are fellow-heirs
   with the Jews, belong to the same body and share the promise with them,
   through the good news

   ^7for which I became a worker by virtue of the gift of God's mercy
   which by the exercise of his power he has given me.

   ^8To me, the very least of all his people, this favor has been given,
   of preaching to the heathen the inexhaustible wealth of the Christ,

   ^9and making clear how the secret purpose is to be worked out which has
   been hidden away for ages in God the creator of all things,

   ^10so that the many-sided wisdom of God may now through the church be
   made known to the rulers and authorities in heaven,

   ^11fulfilling the eternal purpose which God carried out in Christ Jesus
   our Lord.

   ^12Through union with him and through faith in him, we have courage to
   approach God with confidence.

   ^13So I ask that what I am having to suffer for your sake may not make
   me lose heart, for it does you honor.

   ^14For this reason I kneel before the Father

   ^15from whom every family in heaven or on earth takes its name,

   ^16and beg him out of his wealth of glory to strengthen you mightily
   through his Spirit in your inner nature

   ^17and through your faith to let Christ in his love make his home in
   your hearts. Your roots must be deep and your foundations strong,

   ^18so that you and all God's people may be strong enough to grasp what
   breadth, length, height, and depth mean,

   ^19and to understand Christ's love, so far beyond our understanding, so
   that you may be filled with the very fulness of God.

   ^20To him who by the exertion of his power within us can do unutterably
   more than all we ask or imagine,

   ^21be glory through the church and through Christ Jesus through all
   generations forever and ever. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1So I, the prisoner for the Lord's sake, appeal to you to live lives
   worthy of the summons you have received;

   ^2with perfect humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one
   another lovingly.

   ^3Make every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit through the tie
   of peace.

   ^4There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there is but one hope
   that belongs to the summons you received.

   ^5There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

   ^6one God and Father of all, who is above us all, pervades us all, and
   is within us all.

   ^7But each one of us has been given mercy in Christ's generous measure.

   ^8So it says,

   "When he went up on high, he led a host of captives,

   And gave gifts to mankind."

   ^9What does "he went up" mean, except that he had first gone down to
   the under parts of the earth?

   ^10It is he who went down who has also gone up above all the heavens,
   to fill the universe.

   ^11And he has given us some men as apostles, some as prophets, some as
   missionaries, some as pastors and teachers,

   ^12in order to fit his people for the work of service, for building the
   body of Christ,

   ^13until we all attain unity in faith, and in the knowledge of the Son
   of God, and reach mature manhood, and that full measure of development
   found in Christ.

   ^14We must not be babies any longer, blown about and swung around by
   every wind of doctrine through the trickery of men with their ingenuity
   in inventing error.

   ^15We must lovingly hold to the truth and grow up into perfect union
   with him who is the head--Christ himself.

   ^16For it is under his control that the whole system, adjusted and
   united by each ligament of its equipment, develops in proportion to the
   functioning of each particular part, and so builds itself up through
   love.

   ^17So what I mean and insist upon in the Lord's name is this: You must
   no longer live like the heathen, with their frivolity of mind and
   darkened understanding.

   ^18They are estranged from the life of God because of the ignorance
   that exists among them and their obstinacy of heart,

   ^19for they have become callous, and abandoned themselves to
   sensuality, greedily practicing every kind of vice.

   ^20That is not the way you have been taught what Christ means,

   ^21at least if you have really become acquainted with him and been
   instructed in him, and in union with him have been taught the truth as
   it is found in Jesus.

   ^22You must lay aside with your former habits your old self which is
   going to ruin through its deceptive passions.

   ^23You must adopt a new attitude of mind,

   ^24and put on the new self which has been created in likeness to God,
   with all the uprightness and holiness that belong to the truth.

   ^25So you must lay aside falsehood and each tell his neighbor the
   truth, for we are parts of one another.

   ^26Be angry, but do not sin. The sun must not go down upon your anger;

   ^27you must not give the devil a chance.

   ^28The man who stole must not steal any more; he must work with his
   hands at honest toil instead, so as to have something to share with
   those who are in need.

   ^29No bad word must ever pass your lips, but only words that are good
   and suited to improve the occasion, so that they will be a blessing to
   those who hear them.

   ^30You must not offend God's holy Spirit, with which you have been
   marked for the Day of Redemption.

   ^31You must give up all bitterness, rage, anger, and loud, abusive
   talk, and all spite.

   ^32You must be kind to one another, you must be tender-hearted, and
   forgive one another just as God through Christ has forgiven you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1So follow God's example, like his dear children,

   ^2and lead loving lives, just as Christ loved you and gave himself for
   you, as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

   ^3But immorality or any form of vice or greed must not be so much as
   mentioned among you; that would not be becoming in God's people.

   ^4There must be no indecency or foolish or scurrilous talk--all that is
   unbecoming. There should be thanksgiving instead.

   ^5For you may be sure that no one who is immoral, or greedy for gain
   (for that is idolatry) can have any share in the Kingdom of Christ and
   God.

   ^6Whatever anyone may say in the way of worthless arguments to deceive
   you, these are the things that are bringing God's anger down upon the
   disobedient.

   ^7Therefore have nothing to do with them.

   ^8For once you were sheer darkness, but now, as Christians, you are
   light itself. You must live like children of light,

   ^9for light leads to perfect goodness, uprightness, and truth;

   ^10you must make sure what pleases the Lord.

   ^11Have nothing to do with the profitless doings of the darkness;
   expose them instead.

   ^12For while it is degrading even to mention their secret practices,

   ^13yet when anything is exposed by the light, it is made visible, and
   anything that is made visible is light.

   ^14So it says,

   "Wake up, sleeper!

   Rise from the dead,

   And Christ will dawn upon you!"

   ^15Be very careful, then, about the way you live. Do not act
   thoughtlessly, but like sensible men,

   ^16and make the most of your opportunity, for these are evil times.

   ^17So do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.

   ^18Do not get drunk on wine, for that is profligacy, but be filled with
   the Spirit,

   ^19and speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and sacred songs. Sing
   praise to God with all your hearts;

   ^20always give thanks for everything to God our Father, as followers of
   our Lord Jesus Christ,

   ^21and subordinate yourselves to one another out of reverence to
   Christ.

   ^22You married women must subordinate yourselves to your husbands, as
   you do to the Lord,

   ^23for a husband is the head of his wife, just as Christ is the head of
   the church, which is his body, and is saved by him.

   ^24Just as the church is in subjection to Christ, so married women must
   be, in everything, to their husbands.

   ^25You who are husbands must love your wives, just as Christ loves the
   church and gave himself for her,

   ^26to consecrate her, after cleansing her with the bath in water
   through her confession of him,

   ^27in order to bring the church to himself in all her beauty, without a
   flaw or a wrinkle or anything of the kind, but to be consecrated and
   faultless.

   ^28That is the way husbands ought to love their wives--as if they were
   their own bodies; a man who loves his wife is really loving himself,

   ^29for no one ever hates his own person, but he feeds it and takes care
   of it, just as Christ does with the church,

   ^30for we are parts of his body.

   ^31Therefore a man must leave his father and mother and attach himself
   to his wife, and they must become one.

   ^32This is a great secret, but I understand it of Christ and the
   church.

   ^33But each one of you must love his wife just as he loves himself, and
   the wife, too, must respect her husband.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1Children, as Christians obey your parents, for that is right.

   ^2"You must honor your father and mother"--that is the first
   commandment accompanied with a promise--

   ^3"so that you may prosper and have a long life on earth."

   ^4You fathers, too, must not irritate your children, but you must bring
   them up with Christian training and instruction.

   ^5You who are slaves, obey your earthly masters, in reverence and awe,
   with sincerity of heart, as you would the Christ,

   ^6not with mere external service, as though you had only men to please,
   but like slaves of Christ, carrying out the will of God.

   ^7Do your duties heartily and willingly, as though it were for the
   Lord, not for men,

   ^8for you know that everyone, slave or free, will be rewarded by the
   Lord for his good conduct.

   ^9You who are masters, too, must treat your slaves in the same way, and
   cease to threaten them, for you know that their Master and yours is in
   heaven, and that he will show no partiality.

   ^10Henceforth you must grow strong through union with the Lord and
   through his mighty strength.

   ^11You must put on God's armor, so as to be able to stand up against
   the devil's stratagems.

   ^12For we have to struggle, not with enemies of flesh and blood, but
   with the hierarchies, the authorities, the master-spirits of this dark
   world, the spirit-forces of evil on high.

   ^13So you must take God's armor, so that when the evil day comes you
   will be able to make a stand, and when it is all over to hold your
   ground.

   ^14Stand your ground, then, with the belt of truth around your waist,
   and put on uprightness as your coat of mail,

   ^15and on your feet put the readiness the good news of peace brings.

   ^16Besides all these, take faith for your shield, for with it you will
   be able to put out all the flaming missiles of the evil one,

   ^17and take salvation for your helmet, and for your sword the Spirit,
   which is the voice of God.

   ^18Use every kind of prayer and entreaty, and at every opportunity pray
   in the Spirit. Be on the alert about it; devote yourselves constantly
   to prayer for all God's people

   ^19and for me, that when I open my lips I may be given a message, so
   that I may boldly make known the secret of the good news,

   ^20for the sake of which I am an envoy, and in prison. Pray that, when
   I tell it, I may have the courage to speak as I ought.

   ^21In order that you also may know how I am, our dear brother Tychicus,
   a faithful helper in the Lord's service, will tell you all about it.

   ^22That is the very reason I am sending him, to let you know how I am,
   and to cheer your hearts.

   ^23God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give the brothers peace and
   love, with faith.

   ^24God's blessing be with all who have an unfailing love for our Lord
   Jesus Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Letter to the Philippians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the devoted
   adherents of Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the superintendents
   and assistants;

   ^2God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you
   peace.

   ^3I never think of you without thanking my God,

   ^4and always whenever I pray for you all I do it with joy,

   ^5over your co-operation in the good news from the day you first
   received it until now.

   ^6For I am certain that he who has begun the good work in you will
   finish it for the Day of Jesus Christ.

   ^7And I have a right to feel in this way about you all, because both
   when I am in prison and when I am defending and vindicating our right
   to preach the good news, I have you in my heart as all sharing that
   privilege with me.

   ^8For God is my witness how I yearn for you all with the affection of
   Christ Jesus himself.

   ^9And it is my prayer that your love may grow richer and richer in
   knowledge and perfect insight,

   ^10so that you may have a sense of what is vital, and may be men of
   transparent character and blameless life, in preparation for the Day of
   Christ,

   ^11with your lives filled with the fruits which uprightness produces
   through Jesus Christ, to the honor and praise of God.

   ^12Now I want to assure you, brothers, that what has happened to me has
   actually resulted in furthering the preaching of the good news.

   ^13Thus it is generally known throughout the Imperial Guard and
   elsewhere that it is for the sake of Christ that I am in prison,

   ^14and so most of the Christian brothers have been exceedingly
   encouraged by my example to declare God's message without any fear of
   the consequences.

   ^15Some of them, it is true, are actually preaching the Christ from
   jealousy and partisanship, but there are others who are doing it out of
   good-will.

   ^16These latter do it from love for me, for they know that God has put
   me where I am to defend our right to preach the good news.

   ^17But the others are preaching the Christ not sincerely but for their
   own ends, imagining that they are making my imprisonment harder to
   bear.

   ^18But what difference does it make? All that matters is that, in one
   way or another, from false motives or honest ones, Christ is being made
   known; I am glad of that. Yes, and I expect to be glad,

   ^19for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of
   Jesus Christ, all this will turn out for my highest welfare,

   ^20for I eagerly and confidently hope that I shall never disgrace
   myself but that this time as always hitherto, living or dying, I shall
   do Christ credit by my unfailing courage.

   ^21For, as I see it, living means Christ and dying something even
   better.

   ^22But if living on here means having my labor bear fruit, I cannot
   tell which to choose.

   ^23I am undecided between the two, for I long to depart and be with
   Christ, for that is far, far better,

   ^24and yet your needs make it very necessary for me to stay on here.

   ^25I am convinced of this, and so I know that I shall stay on and serve
   you all, to help you to develop and to be glad in your faith.

   ^26So you will find in me fresh cause for Christian exultation, through
   having me with you again.

   ^27Whatever happens, show yourselves citizens worthy of the good news
   of the Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am kept away and
   only hear news of you, I may know that you are standing firm with one
   spirit, one purpose, fighting side by side for faith in the good news.

   ^28Never for a moment falter before your opponents, for your
   fearlessness will be a sure sign for them of their coming destruction,
   but to you it will be an omen, from God himself, of your deliverance.

   ^29For you have been granted the privilege not only of trusting in
   Christ but of suffering for him.

   ^30Take your part in the same struggle that you have seen me engage in
   and that you hear I am still keeping up.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1So by whatever appeal there is in our relation to Christ, by whatever
   incentive there is in love, by whatever participation there is in the
   Spirit, whatever affection and sympathy,

   ^2make me perfectly happy by living in harmony, with the same attitude
   of love, with the same feeling and purpose.

   ^3Do not act for selfish ends or from vanity, but modestly treat one
   another as your superiors.

   ^4Do not take account of your own interests, but of the interests of
   others as well.

   ^5Have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.

   ^6Though he possessed the nature of God, he did not grasp at equality
   with God,

   ^7but laid it aside to take on the nature of a slave and become like
   other men.

   ^8When he had assumed human form, he still further humbled himself and
   carried his obedience so far as to die, and to die upon the cross.

   ^9That is why God has so greatly exalted him, and given him the name
   above all others,

   ^10so that in the name of Jesus everyone should kneel, in heaven and on
   earth and in the underworld,

   ^11and everyone should acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord, and thus
   glorify God the Father.

   ^12So, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient, with
   reverence and awe make every effort to insure your salvation, not
   simply as though I were with you, but all the more because I am away.

   ^13For it is God who in his good will is at work in your hearts,
   inspiring your will and your action.

   ^14Do everything without any grumbling or disputing,

   ^15so that you will be blameless and honest, faultless children of God
   in the midst of a crooked and perverted age, in which you appear like
   stars in a dark world,

   ^16offering men the message of life. Then I will have reason to boast
   of you on the Day of Christ, because my exertion and labor have not
   been wasted.

   ^17Even if my life is to be poured out as a libation as you offer your
   faith in a service of sacrifice to God, I am glad to have it so, and I
   congratulate you upon it,

   ^18just as you must be glad and congratulate me.

   ^19I hope, with the help of the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you
   soon, so that I, too, may be cheered by having news about you.

   ^20For I have no one like him who would take such a real interest in
   you.

   ^21For they are all looking out for their own interests, not for those
   of Jesus Christ.

   ^22But you know his character, and how like a son helping his father he
   has worked like a slave with me in preaching the good news.

   ^23So I hope to send him to you just as soon as I can see how my case
   is going to turn out.

   ^24I trust the Lord to enable me to come to you myself before long.

   ^25But I feel that I must send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother,
   fellow-laborer, and fellow-soldier, whom you sent to look after my
   needs.

   ^26For he has been longing to see you all, and has been greatly
   distressed because you heard that he was sick.

   ^27For he was sick, and nearly died, but God took pity on him, and not
   only on him, but on me, to save me from having one sorrow after
   another.

   ^28So I am all the more eager to send him, so that you may have the
   pleasure of seeing him again, and I may feel more relieved.

   ^29So give him a hearty Christian welcome, and value men like him very
   highly,

   ^30for he came near dying for the Lord's work, and risked his life to
   make up for what was lacking in the service you have done me.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Now, my brothers, goodbye, and the Lord be with you. I do not mind
   writing the same thing over and over to you; it is necessary for your
   safety.

   ^2Look out for those dogs, those mischief-makers, with their
   amputation!

   ^3We are the true circumcision, who worship God by his Spirit, priding
   ourselves only on Christ Jesus, and not relying on physical advantages,

   ^4though I at least am entitled to rely on them.

   If anyone thinks he can rely on his physical advantages, still more can
   I!

   ^5I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a descendant of
   Israel. I belong to the tribe of Benjamin. I am a Hebrew, and the son
   of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee;

   ^6as to my zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; and by the Law's
   standard of uprightness, no fault could be found with me.

   ^7But for the sake of Christ I have come to count my former gains as
   loss.

   ^8Why, I count everything as loss compared with the supreme advantage
   of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have lost everything,
   and think it rubbish, in order to gain Christ

   ^9and be known to be united to him, with any uprightness I may have not
   based on law but coming through faith in Christ--the uprightness that
   comes from God through faith.

   ^10I want to know him in the power of resurrection, and to share his
   sufferings and even his death,

   ^11in the hope of attaining resurrection from the dead.

   ^12Not that I have secured it yet, or already reached perfection, but I
   am pressing on to see if I can capture it, because I have been captured
   by Jesus Christ.

   ^13Brothers, I do not consider that I have captured it yet, only,
   forgetting what is behind me, and straining toward what lies ahead,

   ^14I am pressing toward the goal, for the prize to which God through
   Christ Jesus calls us upward.

   ^15Let as many of us therefore as are mature have this attitude. If you
   have any different attitude, God will make this clear to you.

   ^16Only we must live up to what we have already attained.

   ^17Follow my example, brothers, all of you, and notice those who follow
   the pattern we have set you.

   ^18For there are many who live, as I have often told you, and tell you
   now with tears, like enemies of the cross of Christ.

   ^19They are doomed to destruction: their appetites are their god; they
   glory in their shame; they are absorbed in earthly matters.

   ^20But the commonwealth to which we belong is in heaven, and from it we
   are eagerly awaiting the coming of a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

   ^21He will make our poor bodies over to resemble his glorious body, by
   exerting the power he has to subject everything to himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1So, my dear brothers whom I so long to see, my joy and pride, stand
   firm in the Lord, dear friends.

   ^2I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Syntyche to agree together, as
   Christians.

   ^3And I beg you, my true comrade, help them, for they toiled at my side
   in spreading the good news, with Clement and the rest of my
   fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.

   ^4Goodbye, and the Lord be with you always. Again I say, goodbye.

   ^5Let all men see your forbearing spirit. The Lord is coming soon.

   ^6Have no anxiety about anything, but make all your wants known to God
   in prayer and entreaty, and with thanksgiving.

   ^7Then, through your union with Christ Jesus, the peace of God, so far
   above any human thought, will guard your minds and thoughts.

   ^8Now, brothers, let your minds dwell on what is true, what is worthy,
   what is right, what is pure, what is amiable, what is kindly--on
   everything that is excellent or praiseworthy.

   ^9Do the things that you learned, received, and heard from me, and that
   you saw me do. Then God who gives peace will be with you.

   ^10I was very glad, as a Christian, to have your interest in me revive
   again after so long; for you have always been interested, but you have
   had no opportunity to show it.

   ^11Not that I have anything to complain of, for I have learned how to
   be contented with the condition I am in.

   ^12I know how to live humbly and I know how to enjoy plenty. I have
   learned the secret, in any and all conditions, of being well-fed and of
   going hungry, of having plenty and of going without.

   ^13I can do anything through him who gives me strength.

   ^14But it was very kind of you to share my difficulties.

   ^15And you at Philippi know as well as I do, that in the early days of
   the good news, after I left Macedonia, no church but yours went into
   partnership and opened an account with me.

   ^16Even when I was at Thessalonica you sent money more than once for my
   needs.

   ^17Not that I want your gifts, but I want you to have the profits that
   will accumulate to your credit.

   ^18You have paid me in full, and more too. I am fully supplied with
   what I have received from you through Epaphroditus. It is like fragrant
   incense, just such a sacrifice as God welcomes and approves.

   ^19My God will gloriously supply all your needs with his wealth,
   through your union with Christ Jesus.

   ^20Glory to our God and Father forever and ever. Amen.

   ^21Remember me to all my fellow-Christians. The brothers who are with
   me wish to be remembered to you.

   ^22All God's people wish to be remembered to you, especially those who
   belong to the emperor's household.

   ^23The blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits.

The Letter to the Colossians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, by God's will an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother
   Timothy,

   ^2to the devoted and steadfast Christian brothers in Colossae; God our
   Father bless you and give you peace.

   ^3We never pray for you without thanking God, the Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ,

   ^4for what we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
   you have for all God's people,

   ^5and for the hope of what is stored up for you in heaven. You first
   heard of it long ago when the true message of the gospel

   ^6came among you, to thrive and bear its fruit among you, as it does
   all over the world, from the time when you first heard about the mercy
   of God,

   ^7and really came to know it, in the form in which Epaphras, my dear
   fellow-slave, taught it to you. He is my faithful representative as a
   servant of Christ,

   ^8and it is he who has told me of the love the Spirit has awakened in
   you.

   ^9That is why, from the day I first heard of it, I have never given up
   praying for you and asking God to fill you, through full spiritual
   wisdom and insight, with a clear knowledge of what his will is,

   ^10so that the lives you live may be worthy of your Master and wholly
   pleasing to him, and you may be fruitful in all kinds of good deeds,
   and may grow into fuller knowledge of God.

   ^11Then, so mighty is his majesty, he will nerve you perfectly with
   strength for the cheerful exercise of endurance and forbearance in
   every situation,

   ^12and you will thank the Father who has entitled you to share the lot
   of God's people in the realm of light.

   ^13He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness, and has transferred
   us into the realm of his dear Son,

   ^14by whom we have been ransomed from captivity through having our sins
   forgiven.

   ^15He is a likeness of the unseen God, born before any creature,

   ^16for it was through him that everything was created in heaven and on
   earth, the seen and the unseen, angelic thrones, dominions,
   principalities, authorities--all things were created through him and
   for him.

   ^17He existed before all things and he sustains and embraces them all.

   ^18He is the head of the church, it is his body; for he is the
   beginning, the firstborn from among the dead--that he might come to
   stand first in everything.

   ^19For all the divine fulness chose to dwell in him,

   ^20and through him to reconcile to God all things on earth or in
   heaven, making this peace through his blood shed on the cross.

   ^21And it has brought you, who were once estranged from him, hostile in
   attitude and engaged in doing wrong (though now he has reconciled you

   ^22through dying in his human body) in holiness, and free from reproach
   or blame, into God's presence--

   ^23if at least you continue firm and steadfast in the exercise of
   faith, and never shift from the hope held out in the good news to which
   you listened, which has been preached all over the world, and for which
   I, Paul, became a worker.

   ^24At present I am glad to be suffering in your interest, and I am
   making up in my own person what is lacking in Christ's sufferings for
   the church, which is his body.

   ^25In it, by divine appointment, I became a worker, that I might preach
   among you the message of God in its fulness--

   ^26that secret, hidden from the ages and generations, but now disclosed
   to those who are consecrated to him,

   ^27to whom God has chosen to make known among the heathen how glorious
   this mystery of Christ in you, the promise of glorification, really is.

   ^28And in spreading the news of him, we warn everyone and teach
   everyone all our wisdom, in order to bring everyone to Christian
   perfection.

   ^29That is what I am working for, fighting with all the energy with
   which he so mightily endows me.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1For I want you to know what a fight I am putting up for you and for
   our brothers in Laodicea, and for all who do not know me personally,

   ^2that your hearts may be cheered. I want you to be united by love, and
   to have all the benefit of assured knowledge in coming to know Christ--

   ^3that divine mystery in which all treasures of wisdom and knowledge
   are to be found.

   ^4What I mean is, let nobody mislead you by specious arguments.

   ^5For though I am absent from you in person I am with you in spirit,
   and I am glad to observe your harmony and the solidity of your faith in
   Christ.

   ^6So just as you once accepted the Christ, Jesus, as your Lord, you
   must live in vital union with him.

   ^7You must be rooted and built up in him and made strong in faith, just
   as you were taught to be, overflowing with it in your gratitude.

   ^8Take care that nobody exploits you through the pretensions of
   philosophy, guided by human tradition, following material ways of
   looking at things, instead of following Christ.

   ^9For it is in him that all the fulness of God's nature lives embodied,

   ^10and in union with him you too are filled with it. He is the head of
   all your principalities and dominions.

   ^11Through your relation to him you have received not a physical
   circumcision, but a circumcision effected by Christ, in stripping you
   of your material nature,

   ^12when in your baptism you were buried with him, and raised to life
   with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the
   dead.

   ^13Yes, you who were dead through your misdeeds and physically
   uncircumcised, God raised to life with Christ. He forgave us all our
   misdeeds,

   ^14canceled the bond which stood against us, with its requirements, and
   put it out of our way when he nailed it to the cross.

   ^15He disarmed the principalities and dominions and displayed them
   openly, triumphing over them through him.

   ^16So no one can call you to account for what you eat or drink, or do
   about annual or monthly feasts or Sabbaths.

   ^17That was all only the shadow of something that was to follow; the
   reality is found in Christ.

   ^18No one can put you in the wrong by persisting in studied humility
   and the worship of angels, being absorbed in the visions he has seen,
   and groundlessly conceited over his mere human mind.

   ^19Such people lose their connection with the head, from which the
   whole body through its ligaments and sinews must be governed and united
   if it is to grow in the divine way.

   ^20If you have died with Christ to material ways of looking at things,
   why do you act as though you still belonged to the world, and submit to
   rules like

   ^21"You must not handle," "You must not taste," "You must not touch"--

   ^22referring to things that are all meant to be used up and destroyed?
   This is to follow mere human rules and regulations.

   ^23Such practices pass for wisdom, with their self-imposed devotions,
   their self-humiliation, and their ascetic discipline, but they carry
   with them no real distinction, they are really only a catering to the
   flesh.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1If, then, you have been raised to life with Christ, set your hearts
   on the things that are where Christ is, above, seated at God's right
   hand.

   ^2Fix your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are
   on earth.

   ^3For you have died, and your life now lies hidden with Christ in God.

   ^4When Christ, who is our true life, shall make his appearance, then
   you also will appear glorified with him.

   ^5So treat as dead your physical nature, as far as immorality,
   impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed are concerned; for it is
   really idolatry.

   ^6It is on account of these things that God's anger is coming.

   ^7And you once practiced them as others do, when you lived that old
   earthly life.

   ^8But now you too must put them all aside--anger, rage, spite, rough,
   abusive talk--these must be banished from your lips.

   ^9You must not lie to one another. For you have stripped off your old
   self with its ways

   ^10and have put on that new self newly made in the likeness of its
   Creator, to know him fully.

   ^11Here, what matters is not "Greek" and "Jew," the circumcised and the
   uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeborn, but Christ is
   everything and in us all.

   ^12As persons chosen by God, then, consecrated and dearly loved, you
   must clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindness, humility,
   gentleness, forbearance.

   ^13You must bear with one another and forgive one another, if anyone
   has reason to be offended with anyone else. Just as the Lord has
   forgiven you, so you must forgive.

   ^14And over all these put on love, which completes them and fastens
   them all together.

   ^15Let the ruling principle in your hearts be Christ's peace, for in
   becoming members of one body you have been called under its sway. And
   you must be thankful.

   ^16Let the message of Christ live in your hearts in all its wealth of
   wisdom. Teach it to one another and train one another in it with
   thankfulness, with psalms, hymns, and sacred songs, and sing to God
   with all your hearts.

   ^17And whatever you have to say or do, do it all as followers of the
   Lord Jesus, and offer your thanksgiving to God the Father through him.

   ^18You married women must subordinate yourselves to your husbands, for
   that is your duty as Christians.

   ^19You who are husbands must love your wives and not be harsh to them.

   ^20Children, always obey your parents, for that is commendable in
   Christians.

   ^21Fathers, do not irritate your children, or they may lose heart.

   ^22You who are slaves must always obey your earthly masters, not with
   mere external service, as though you had only men to please, but with
   sincerity of heart, because you fear the Lord.

   ^23Work at everything you do with all your hearts, as work done not for
   men only but for the Lord,

   ^24for you know that it is from him that you are to receive that
   inheritance which is to be your reward. Think of Christ as the master
   you are working for.

   ^25For the man who wrongs anyone will be paid back for the wrong he has
   done; there will be no exceptions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1You who are masters must treat your slaves justly and fairly, and
   remember that you have a Master too, in heaven.

   ^2Be persistent in prayer and wide awake about it when you give thanks.

   ^3Pray for me too, that God may give me an opening for the message, and
   let me tell the secret of Christ on account of which I am kept in
   prison

   ^4until I can make clear to the authorities why I cannot help telling
   it.

   ^5Use wisdom in dealing with outsiders, making the most of your
   opportunities.

   ^6Always put your message attractively, and yet pointedly, and be
   prepared to give every inquirer a fitting answer.

   ^7Our dear brother Tychicus, my faithful helper and fellow-servant in
   the Lord's work, will tell you all about me.

   ^8I am sending him to you for the express purpose of letting you know
   my circumstances, and of cheering your hearts.

   ^9And with him I send my dear, faithful brother Onesimus, who is one of
   your own number. They will tell you all about matters here.

   ^10Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, wishes to be remembered to you, and
   so does Barnabas' cousin Mark. (About him you have had instructions; if
   he comes to see you, make him welcome.)

   ^11So also does Jesus who is called Justus. They are the only ones
   among the converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the reign
   of God who have proved a comfort to me.

   ^12Epaphras, one of your own number, a slave of Christ Jesus, wishes to
   be remembered to you. He is always standing up for you in his prayers
   that you may stand fast, like men of mature convictions, whatever God's
   will for you may be.

   ^13I can testify how anxious he is about you and the brothers in
   Laodicea and Hierapolis.

   ^14Our dear Luke, the doctor, and Demas wish to be remembered to you.

   ^15Remember me to the brothers in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church
   that meets at her house.

   ^16When this letter has been read to you, have it read to the church at
   Laodicea also, and see that you read the letter that is coming from
   there.

   ^17And tell Archippus, "See that you perform the Christian service you
   have been assigned."

   ^18This farewell is in my own hand, from Paul. Remember that I am in
   prison. God bless you.

The First Letter to the Thessalonians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the Thessalonian church in union with
   God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; God bless you and give you
   peace.

   ^2We always thank God for you all when we mention you in our prayers,

   ^3for we can never forget before our God and Father your energetic
   faith, your loving service, and your unwavering expectation of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   ^4For we know, brothers whom God so loves, that he has chosen you,

   ^5for our preaching of the good news did not come to you as mere words
   but with power and the holy Spirit and full conviction--you know the
   kind of life we lived among you for your good.

   ^6And you followed the example set by us and by the Lord, for though
   our message brought you great trouble, you welcomed it with joy
   inspired by the holy Spirit,

   ^7so that you set an example to all the believers in Macedonia and
   Greece.

   ^8For the Lord's message has rung out from you not only over Macedonia
   and Greece, but the story of your belief in God has gone everywhere, so
   that we never need to mention it.

   ^9For when people speak of us, they tell what a welcome you gave us,
   and how you turned from idols to God, to serve a true and living God,

   ^10and to wait for the coming from heaven of his Son, whom he raised
   from the dead--Jesus, our deliverer from God's coming wrath.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1You know yourselves, brothers, that our visit to you was far from
   ineffectual.

   ^2We had just been through ill-treatment and insults at Philippi, as
   you remember, but, in the face of great opposition, we took courage by
   the help of our God, and told you God's good news.

   ^3For our appeal does not rest on a delusion, nor spring from any
   impure motive; there is no fraud about it.

   ^4God has thought us fit to be intrusted with the good news, and so we
   tell it, making no effort to please men, but to please God, who tests
   our hearts.

   ^5We never used flattery, as you know, or found pretexts for making
   money, as God is our witness.

   ^6We never sought praise from men, either from you or anyone else,
   though as Christ's apostles we might have stood on our dignity.

   ^7We were children when we were with you; we were like a mother nursing
   her children.

   ^8That was the kind of affection we had for you, which made us ready to
   share with you not only God's good news but our own lives too, because
   you were so dear to us.

   ^9You remember, brothers, how we toiled and labored. We worked night
   and day, when we preached the good news to you, in order not to be a
   burden to any of you.

   ^10You will testify, and God will, how pure and upright and
   irreproachable our relations were with you who believed.

   ^11You know how, like a father with his children, we used to urge,
   encourage, and implore you

   ^12to make your lives worthy of God who invites you into his kingdom
   and his glory.

   ^13We for our part constantly thank God for another reason too--because
   when you received God's message from our lips, you welcomed it not as
   the message of men but as the message of God, as it really is, which
   does its work in the hearts of you believers.

   ^14For you, brothers, followed the example of God's churches in Judea
   that are in union with Christ Jesus, for you in your turn had to bear
   the same ill-treatment from your neighbors as they did from the Jews,

   ^15who killed the Lord Jesus and persecuted the prophets and us; who
   displease God, and in their hostility to all mankind

   ^16try to keep us from speaking to the heathen so that they may be
   saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's
   wrath has overtaken them at last!

   ^17For our part, brothers, when we were separated from you for a little
   while--in person, though not in spirit--we were extremely eager and
   longed intensely to see you.

   ^18For we resolved to come to see you--I, Paul, did so again and
   again--but Satan held us back.

   ^19For what hope or happiness shall we have or what prize to be proud
   of in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes, except you?

   ^20You are our pride and our joy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1So when I could not bear it any longer, I made up my mind to stay
   behind alone at Athens,

   ^2and I sent my brother Timothy, a servant of God in preaching the good
   news of the Christ, to strengthen you in your faith

   ^3and encourage you not to be led astray, any of you, in all these
   troubles. You know yourselves that this is what we must expect,

   ^4for when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were going
   to have trouble, and it came true, as you know.

   ^5That was why, when I could not bear it any longer, I sent to find out
   about your faith, for I was afraid that the tempter might have tempted
   you and all our labor might be lost.

   ^6But now that Timothy has just come back to me from you, and brought
   me good news of your faith and love, and told me how kindly you think
   of me and that you long to see me just as much as I long to see you,

   ^7I feel encouraged, brothers, about you, in spite of all my distress
   and trouble, at your faith,

   ^8for now I can really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.

   ^9For how can I thank God enough for you, for all the happiness you
   make me feel in the presence of our God,

   ^10as I pray night and day with intense earnestness that I may see your
   faces and supply what is lacking in your faith?

   ^11May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus open my way to
   you!

   ^12May the Lord make your love for one another and for all men wide and
   full like my love for you,

   ^13so that your hearts may be strong and faultlessly pure in the sight
   of our God and Father, when our Lord Jesus appears with all his saints!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1Now, brothers, we ask and entreat you, in the name of the Lord Jesus,
   to live as you learned from us that you must live, to please God--as
   indeed you are doing, only do it more and more.

   ^2For you remember what instructions we gave you on the authority of
   the Lord Jesus.

   ^3It is God's will that you should be consecrated, that you abstain
   from immorality,

   ^4that each of you learn to take a wife for himself from pure and
   honorable motives,

   ^5not to gratify his passion, like the heathen who know nothing of God.

   ^6No one is to wrong or defraud his brother in this matter, for the
   Lord avenges all such things, as we told you before, in the most solemn
   terms.

   ^7God has not called us to an unclean life, but to a pure one.

   ^8So whoever disregards this is not disregarding man, but God, who
   gives you his holy Spirit.

   ^9You do not need to have anyone write to you about brotherly love, for
   you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another,

   ^10and you are doing it to all the brothers all over Macedonia.

   But we do entreat you, brothers, to surpass yourselves

   ^11in striving to live quietly and mind your own affairs, and work with
   your hands, as we directed you,

   ^12so that you may have the respect of the outsiders, and not be
   dependent upon anybody.

   ^13We do not want you to be under any misapprehension, brothers, about
   those who are falling asleep. You must not grieve for them, as others
   do who have no hope.

   ^14For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, then by means of
   Jesus God will bring back with him those who have fallen asleep.

   ^15For we can assure you, on the Lord's own authority, that those of us
   who will still be living when the Lord comes will have no advantage
   over those who have fallen asleep.

   ^16For the Lord himself, at the summons, when the archangel calls and
   God's trumpet sounds, will come down from heaven, and first those who
   died in union with Christ will rise;

   ^17then those of us who are still living will be caught up with them on
   clouds into the air to meet the Lord, and so we shall be with the Lord
   forever.

   ^18Therefore, encourage one another with this truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1But as to times and dates, brothers, you do not need to have anyone
   write to you,

   ^2for you yourselves know perfectly well that the Day of the Lord is to
   come like a thief in the night.

   ^3When people say, "What peace and security!" then suddenly destruction
   will be upon them, like birth-pains upon a woman about to give birth to
   a child, and there will be no escape.

   ^4But you are not in darkness, brothers, so that that Day should
   surprise you like thieves.

   ^5You all belong to the light and the day. We have nothing to do with
   night or with darkness.

   ^6So we must not sleep like other men, but we must be vigilant and
   composed.

   ^7For those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk do so at
   night,

   ^8but we who belong to the day must be composed, wearing faith and love
   for a coat of mail, and helmeted with the hope of salvation.

   ^9For God has not destined us for his wrath, but to gain salvation
   through our Lord Jesus Christ,

   ^10who died for us so that whether we are still alive or fall asleep we
   may live with him.

   ^11Therefore encourage one another and strengthen one another, just as
   you are doing.

   ^12We beg you, brothers, to respect those who work with you and who
   lead you in the service of the Lord, and teach you.

   ^13Hold them in the highest esteem and affection for what they do. Live
   at peace with one another.

   ^14We beg you, brothers, warn the idlers, cheer up the despondent, keep
   hold of the weak, be patient with everybody.

   ^15Take care that none of you ever pays back evil for evil, but always
   try to treat one another and everybody with kindness.

   ^16Always be joyful.

   ^17Never give up praying.

   ^18Thank God whatever happens. For this is what God through Christ
   Jesus wants you to do.

   ^19Do not stifle the Spirit.

   ^20Do not disregard the utterances it inspires,

   ^21but test them all, retaining what is good

   ^22and avoiding every kind of evil.

   ^23May God himself, the giver of peace, consecrate you through and
   through. Spirit, soul, and body, may you be kept sound, and be found
   irreproachable when our Lord Jesus Christ comes.

   ^24He who calls you can be relied on, and he will do this.

   ^25Brothers, pray for us.

   ^26Greet all the brothers with a sacred kiss.

   ^27I charge you in the Lord's name to have this letter read to all the
   brothers.

   ^28The blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

The Second Letter to the Thessalonians
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the Thessalonian church in union with
   God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;

   ^2God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you
   peace.

   ^3We always have to thank God for you, brothers, as it is right that we
   should, because your faith is growing so wonderfully and the love of
   every one of you for one another is increasing.

   ^4As a result, we ourselves speak of you with pride in the churches of
   God for your steadfastness and faith in the face of all the
   persecutions and troubles you are having to endure.

   ^5This is a proof of God's justice in judging, and it is to prove you
   worthy of the Kingdom of God, for the sake of which you are suffering,

   ^6since God considers it only just to repay with suffering those who
   are making you suffer

   ^7and to give rest to you who are suffering and to us, when our Lord
   Jesus appears from heaven, with his mighty angels

   ^8in a blaze of fire, and takes vengeance on the godless who will not
   listen to the good news of our Lord Jesus.

   ^9They will be punished with eternal ruin and exclusion from the
   presence of the Lord and his glorious might,

   ^10when on that Day he comes to be honored in his people, and wondered
   at in all who believe in him--because our testimony has been confirmed
   in you.

   ^11To this end we always pray for you too, asking our God to find you
   worthy of the call he has given you, and by his power to fulfil every
   desire you may have for goodness, and every effort of your faith,

   ^12so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you
   in him, by the blessing of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

  Chapter 2

   ^1As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, brothers, and our
   assembling to meet him, we beg you

   ^2not to let your minds be too easily unsettled or wrought up, by any
   message of the Spirit or any utterance or letter purporting to be from
   me, to the effect that the Day of the Lord has already come.

   ^3You must not let anyone deceive you at all. For that is not until the
   rebellion takes place and the embodiment of disobedience makes his
   appearance--he who is doomed to destruction,

   ^4the adversary of every being that is called a god or an object of
   worship, and so overbearing toward them as to enter God's sanctuary and
   take his seat there, proclaiming himself to be God--

   ^5do you not remember that when I was with you, I used to tell you
   this?

   ^6So now you know what it is that is holding him back from making his
   appearance before the appointed time arrives.

   ^7For disobedience is already secretly at work, but only until he who
   is now holding it in check is gotten out of the way.

   ^8Then the embodiment of disobedience will make his appearance, and the
   Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his mouth and annihilate
   him by his appearance and arrival.

   ^9The other's appearance, by the contrivance of Satan, will be full of
   power and pretended signs and wonders,

   ^10and full of wicked deception for men who are going to destruction,
   because they refused to love the truth and be saved.

   ^11This is why God sends upon them a misleading influence, to make them
   believe what is false,

   ^12so that all who have refused to believe the truth but have preferred
   disobedience may be condemned.

   ^13We always have to thank God for you, brothers whom the Lord so
   loves, because God chose you from the beginning to be saved through
   consecration by the Spirit and through faith in the truth,

   ^14and called you to it through our preaching of the good news, so that
   you may share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   ^15So stand firm, brothers, and hold fast to the instructions you have
   received from us, whether by letter or by word of mouth.

   ^16May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved
   us and kindly given us unfailing encouragement and a well-founded hope,

   ^17encourage you and strengthen you to do and say everything that is
   right.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Now, brothers, pray for us, that the Lord's message may spread
   rapidly and gloriously as it did among you,

   ^2and that we may be saved from unjust and wicked men; for not
   everybody has faith.

   ^3But the Lord is to be relied on, and he will give you strength and
   protect you from the evil one.

   ^4We have faith in you through the Lord that you are doing and will
   keep doing what we direct you to do.

   ^5May the Lord guide your hearts into a sense of God's love and into a
   steadfastness like Christ's.

   ^6We charge you, brothers, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to
   keep away from any brother who lives in idleness, instead of following
   the teaching you received from us.

   ^7For you know yourselves what you must do to follow my example, for I
   was not idle when I was with you;

   ^8I did not eat anybody's bread without paying for it, but with toil
   and labor I worked night and day, in order not to be a burden to any of
   you.

   ^9Not that I had not a right to my support, but to give you in my own
   conduct an example to imitate.

   ^10When I was with you, I gave you this rule: "If anyone refuses to
   work, give him nothing to eat!"

   ^11For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere
   busybodies, not doing any work.

   ^12Now with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ we charge and exhort
   such people to keep quiet and do their work and earn their own living.

   ^13But you, brothers, must not get tired of doing right.

   ^14If anyone refuses to obey what we have said in this letter, mark the
   man and do not have anything to do with him, to make him feel ashamed.

   ^15Do not look upon him as an enemy but warn him as a brother.

   ^16And may the Lord of peace himself always give you peace in every
   way. The Lord be with you all.

   ^17This greeting is in my own hand, Paul's; it is the mark in every
   letter of mine. This is the way I write.

   ^18The blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

The First Letter to Timothy
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by order of God our Savior and of
   Jesus Christ our hope,

   ^2to Timothy, my true child in faith; God the Father and Christ Jesus
   our Lord bless you and be merciful to you, and give you peace.

   ^3As I asked you to do when I was on my way to Macedonia, stay on in
   Ephesus in order to warn certain people there not to teach strange
   views

   ^4nor to devote themselves to fictions and interminable pedigrees; such
   things lead to controversy instead of the divine system which operates
   through faith.

   ^5The aim of your instruction must be love that springs from a pure
   heart and from a good conscience and from a sincere faith.

   ^6Some people have failed in these things and been diverted into
   fruitless talk.

   ^7They would like to be teachers of law although they do not understand
   the words they use or the matters they insist upon.

   ^8I agree that the Law is excellent--provided it is legitimately used,

   ^9with the understanding that law is not intended for upright men but
   for the lawless and disorderly, the godless and irreligious, the
   irreverent and profane, men who kill their fathers or mothers,
   murderers,

   ^10immoral people, men sexually perverted, kidnapers, liars, perjurers,
   or whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,

   ^11as set forth in the glorious good news of the blessed God with which
   I have been intrusted.

   ^12I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me the strength for it,
   for thinking me trustworthy and putting me into his service,

   ^13though I once used to abuse, persecute, and insult him. But he had
   mercy on me, because I had acted in ignorance and unbelief,

   ^14and the blessing of our Lord has been given me in the greatest
   abundance, together with faith and love that union with Christ Jesus
   brings.

   ^15It is a trustworthy saying, entitled to the fullest acceptance, that
   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. And I am the foremost
   of them,

   ^16but God had mercy on me in order that in my case as the foremost,
   Christ Jesus might display his perfect patience, as an example to those
   who would later believe in him and find eternal life.

   ^17To the eternal King, immortal and invisible, the one God, be honor
   and glory forever and ever! Amen.

   ^18These are the instructions that I intrust to you, my son Timothy,
   and they are in accordance with the predictions made long ago about
   you. Fight the good fight with their aid,

   ^19keeping hold of faith and a good conscience. For some people have
   let that go and have had their faith ruined,

   ^20like Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I turned over to Satan, to be
   taught not to blaspheme.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1First of all, then, I urge that entreaties, prayers, petitions, and
   thanksgivings be offered for all men,

   ^2for emperors and all who are in authority, so that we may live
   tranquil, quiet lives, with perfect piety and probity.

   ^3It is right to do this, and it pleases God our Savior,

   ^4who wants all men to be saved and to come to know the truth.

   ^5For there is but one God, and one intermediary between God and
   men--the man Christ Jesus,

   ^6who gave himself as a ransom for all men. This is what was testified
   to at the proper times,

   ^7and I was appointed a herald and apostle of it--I am telling the
   truth, I am not lying--to teach the heathen faith and truth.

   ^8I want the men everywhere to offer prayer, lifting to heaven hands
   that are holy, without any angry disputes.

   ^9Women for their part are to dress modestly and sensibly in proper
   clothes, not adorning themselves by braiding their hair or with gold or
   pearls or expensive clothing,

   ^10but, as is appropriate for women who profess to be religious, with
   good actions.

   ^11Women must listen quietly in church and be perfectly submissive.

   ^12I do not allow women to teach or to domineer over men; they must
   keep quiet.

   ^13For Adam was formed first, and then Eve;

   ^14and it was not Adam who was deceived, it was the woman who was
   deluded and fell into sin.

   ^15But they will be saved through motherhood, if they continue to have
   faith and to be loving and holy, and sensible as well.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1This is a trustworthy saying.

   Whoever aspires to the office of superintendent sets his heart on a
   fine work.

   ^2A superintendent must be a man above reproach, only once married,
   temperate, sensible, a man of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach;

   ^3not addicted to drink or pugnacious, but a man of moderation and
   peace, not avaricious,

   ^4managing his own house well, and keeping his children under control
   and perfectly respectful--

   ^5for if a man does not know how to conduct his own household, how can
   he look after a church of God?

   ^6He must not be a new convert, or he may grow conceited and incur
   criticism from slanderous people.

   ^7He must also be a man of good standing with outsiders, or he may get
   into disgrace and be entrapped by the slanderers.

   ^8Assistants, in turn, must be serious, straightforward men, not
   addicted to wine or dishonest gain,

   ^9but holding the divine truth of the faith with a clear conscience.

   ^10They should first be tested, and afterward, if there is no fault to
   be found with them, they can serve as assistants.

   ^11Their wives too must be serious, not gossips; they must be
   temperate, and perfectly trustworthy.

   ^12The assistants must be only once married, and manage their children
   and their households well.

   ^13For those who do good service as assistants gain a good standing for
   themselves and great confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.

   ^14I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing you all this

   ^15so that if I am delayed, you may know how we are to conduct
   ourselves in the household of God, for it is the church of the living
   God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.

   ^16No one can deny the profundity of the divine truth of our religion!

   "He was revealed in flesh,

   He was vindicated by the Spirit,

   He was seen by the angels,

   He was proclaimed among the heathen,

   He was believed in throughout the world,

   He was taken up into glory."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1The Spirit distinctly says that in later times some will turn away
   from the faith, and devote their attention to deceitful spirits and the
   things that demons teach

   ^2through the pretensions of liars--men with seared consciences

   ^3who forbid people to marry and insist on abstinence from certain
   kinds of food that God created for men who believe and understand the
   truth to enjoy and give thanks for.

   ^4For everything God has created is good, and nothing need be refused,
   provided it is accepted with thanksgiving,

   ^5for then it is consecrated by prayer and the Scripture used in it.

   ^6If you point this out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of
   Christ Jesus, living on the principles of the faith and the excellent
   teaching you have had.

   ^7But let worldly fictions and old wives' tales alone. Train yourself
   for the religious life.

   ^8Physical training is of some service, but religion is of service in
   every way, for it carries with it the promise of life here and
   hereafter.

   ^9This is a trustworthy saying, entitled to the fullest acceptance.

   ^10It is for this that we toil and struggle, for we have fixed our
   hopes on the living God, the Savior of all men, especially those who
   believe.

   ^11This is what you must urge and teach.

   ^12Let no one look down on you because you are young, but set those who
   believe an example in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity.

   ^13Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture,
   preaching, and teaching.

   ^14Do not neglect the gift you have, that was given you with
   predictions of your work, when the elders laid their hands upon you.

   ^15Cultivate these things, devote yourself to them, so that everyone
   will see your progress.

   ^16Look out for yourself and for your teaching. Persevere in your work,
   for if you do you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1Never reprove an older man, but appeal to him as to a father. Treat
   younger men like brothers,

   ^2older women like mothers, younger ones like sisters, with absolute
   purity.

   ^3Look after widows who are really dependent.

   ^4If a widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to
   show piety in the treatment of their own families, and to return the
   care of those who brought them up, for that is what God approves.

   ^5But a woman who is really a widow, and has no children, has fixed her
   hope on God, and devotes herself to prayers and entreaties night and
   day.

   ^6A widow who gives herself up to pleasure is dead while she is still
   alive.

   ^7Insist upon these points, so that people may be irreproachable.

   ^8Whoever fails to provide for his own relatives, and particularly for
   members of his own family, has disowned the faith and is worse than an
   unbeliever.

   ^9No one under sixty years of age should be put on the list of widows.
   A widow must have been married but once,

   ^10and have a good reputation for Christian service, such as bringing
   up children, being hospitable to strangers, washing the feet of God's
   people, helping people in distress, or devoting herself to any form of
   doing good.

   ^11Do not put young women on the list of widows, for when their
   youthful vigor comes between them and Christ, they want to marry,

   ^12and become guilty of breaking their previous pledge.

   ^13Besides, as they go about from house to house they learn to be idle,
   and not only idle but gossips and busybodies, and talk of things they
   ought not to mention.

   ^14So I would have young women marry and have children and keep house
   and avoid giving our opponents any excuse for abusing us.

   ^15For some widows have already turned aside to follow Satan.

   ^16Any Christian woman who has widowed relatives should look after
   them, and relieve the church, so that it can look after widows who are
   really dependent.

   ^17Elders who do their duties well should be considered as deserving
   twice as much as they get, particularly those who work at preaching and
   teaching.

   ^18For the Scripture says, "You must not muzzle an ox when it is
   treading out the grain," and the workman deserves his wages.

   ^19Do not listen to an accusation made against an elder, unless it is
   supported by two or three witnesses.

   ^20Those who are found guilty you must reprove publicly, as a warning
   to others.

   ^21I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to
   observe these rules without any discrimination, and to be perfectly
   impartial.

   ^22Never ordain anyone hastily; do not make yourself responsible for
   the sins of others; keep your life pure.

   ^23Stop drinking nothing but water; take a little wine for the good of
   your digestion and for your frequent attacks of illness.

   ^24Some men's sins are perfectly evident, and lead them right on to
   judgment, but there are others whose sins only dog their steps.

   ^25Good deeds too are evident enough, or when they are not, they cannot
   be wholly concealed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1All who are under the yoke of slavery must treat their masters with
   the greatest respect, so that the name of God and our teaching may not
   be abused.

   ^2Those who have Christian masters must not think lightly of them
   because they are brothers; they must serve them all the more
   faithfully, because those who benefit by it are believers and hence
   dear to them.

   These are the things you must teach and preach.

   ^3Anyone who teaches different views and does not agree with the
   wholesome instruction which comes from our Lord Jesus Christ, and with
   religious teaching

   ^4is a conceited, ignorant person, with a morbid craving for
   speculations and arguments which result only in envy, quarreling,
   abuse, base suspicions,

   ^5and mutual irritation between people of depraved minds, who are lost
   to the truth and think of religion only as a means of gain.

   ^6And religion with contentment is a great means of gain.

   ^7For we bring nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of
   it.

   ^8If we have food and clothing we will be satisfied.

   ^9But men who want to get rich fall into temptations and snares and
   many foolish, harmful cravings, that plunge people into destruction and
   ruin.

   ^10For love of money is the root of all the evils, and in their
   eagerness to get rich, some men wander away from the faith and pierce
   themselves to the heart with many a pang.

   ^11But you, man of God, must fly from these things. Strive for
   uprightness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.

   ^12Enter the great contest of faith! Take hold of eternal life, to
   which God called you, when before many witnesses you made the great
   profession of faith.

   ^13Before God who maintains all life, and before Christ Jesus who in
   testifying before Pontius Pilate made his great profession, I charge
   you

   ^14to keep his command stainless and irreproachable until the
   appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ,

   ^15which will be brought about in his own time by the blessed, only
   Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,

   ^16who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light,
   whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal
   dominion. Amen.

   ^17Charge the rich of this world not to be arrogant, nor to set their
   hopes on such an uncertain thing as riches, but on God who richly
   provides us with everything for our enjoyment.

   ^18Charge them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, open-handed and
   generous,

   ^19storing up a valuable treasure for themselves for the future, so as
   to grasp the life that is life indeed.

   ^20Timothy, guard what has been intrusted to you. Keep away from the
   worldly, empty phrases and contradictions of what they falsely call
   knowledge,

   ^21through professing which some people have made a failure of the
   faith. God bless you all.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Second Letter to Timothy
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, by God's will an apostle of Christ Jesus in fulfilment of the
   promise of that life which is found in union with Christ Jesus,

   ^2to my dear child Timothy; God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord
   bless you and be merciful to you and give you peace.

   ^3I thank God, whom I, like my forefathers, worship with a clear
   conscience, when I remember you, as I constantly do, in my prayers.

   ^4When I remember the tears you shed I long night and day to see you
   again, and have the perfect happiness

   ^5of being reminded of your genuine faith, a faith that was seen first
   in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice; I am sure it is in
   you also.

   ^6For this reason I would remind you to rekindle the divine gift that
   you received when I laid my hands upon you.

   ^7For the Spirit God has given us is a spirit not of timidity but of
   power, love, and self-discipline.

   ^8So you must not be ashamed to testify to our Lord, nor be ashamed of
   me who am in prison for his sake, but join with me in suffering for the
   good news, through the power of God.

   ^9He saved us and called us to a consecrated life, not for anything we
   had done, but of his own accord and out of the mercy which he bestowed
   upon us ages ago through Christ Jesus,

   ^10which has now been revealed through the appearance of our Savior
   Christ Jesus. He has taken away the power of death and brought life and
   immortality to light through the good news,

   ^11of which I have been appointed a herald, apostle and teacher.

   ^12This is why I am suffering as I am, but I am not ashamed of it, for
   I know whom I have trusted and I am sure that he is able to guard what
   I have intrusted to him for that Day.

   ^13As your example in wholesome instruction, keep before you what you
   learned from me, in the faith and love that come through union with
   Christ Jesus.

   ^14Guard that splendid trust through the holy Spirit that lives in our
   hearts.

   ^15You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me,
   including Phygelus and Hermogenes.

   ^16May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he
   often cheered me and was not ashamed of my being in prison.

   ^17Why, when he arrived in Rome, he took pains to inquire for me and
   found me.

   ^18The Lord grant that he may be shown mercy by the Lord on that Day!
   And you know well enough how he helped me at Ephesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1So you, my son, must find strength in the blessing that comes through
   Christ Jesus.

   ^2The things you learned from me before many witnesses you must commit
   to trustworthy men who will be capable of teaching others.

   ^3Share my hardships like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

   ^4Anyone who is in the army keeps from being involved in business
   affairs, so as to please the officer who enlisted him.

   ^5No one who competes in the games is awarded a crown unless he obeys
   the rules.

   ^6The farmer who does the work ought to be the first to have some of
   the produce.

   ^7Think over what I say. For the Lord will help you to understand it
   perfectly.

   ^8Remember Jesus Christ as risen from the dead, and descended from
   David, as I preach the good news,

   ^9for the sake of which I even suffer imprisonment as a criminal. But
   God's message is not imprisoned!

   ^10For that reason I am ready to submit to anything for the sake of
   those whom God has chosen, so that they too may gain the salvation that
   comes through Christ Jesus and brings eternal glory.

   ^11How true those words are! "If we have died with him, we will live
   with him!

   ^12If we endure, we will reign with him! If we disown him, he will also
   disown us!

   ^13If we are unfaithful, he will remain faithful, for he cannot be
   false to himself!"

   ^14Remind men of these things. Charge them before God to avoid idle
   arguments which do no one any good and only bring destruction on those
   who listen to them.

   ^15Do your best to win God's approval as a workman who has nothing to
   be ashamed of, but rightly shapes the message of truth.

   ^16Leave worldly, empty phrases alone, for they lead people deeper and
   deeper into godlessness,

   ^17and their teaching spreads like a cancer; men like Hymenaeus and
   Philetus,

   ^18who have missed the truth and say that the resurrection has taken
   place already, thus undermining people's faith.

   ^19Yet God's solid foundation stands unshaken, bearing this
   inscription, "The Lord knows those who belong to him," and "Everyone
   who uses the name of the Lord must give up evil."

   ^20In any large house there are not only gold and silver dishes but
   also wooden and earthen ones, some for great occasions and some for
   ordinary use.

   ^21So if a man will cleanse himself from these things, he will be put
   to great uses, consecrated and used by the master of the house himself,
   and ready for any good use.

   ^22Fly from the cravings of youth, and go in pursuit of uprightness,
   faith, love, and peace, in company with those who call upon the Lord
   with pure hearts.

   ^23Avoid foolish, crude speculations; you know they only lead to
   quarrels,

   ^24and a slave of the Lord must not quarrel, but treat everyone kindly;
   he must be persuasive and unresentful,

   ^25correcting his opponents with gentleness; for God may possibly let
   them repent and acknowledge the truth,

   ^26and they may yet return to their senses and escape from the toils of
   the devil, who has caught them to make them do his will.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Understand this, that in the last days there are going to be hard
   times.

   ^2People will be selfish, avaricious, boastful, arrogant, abusive,
   undutiful, ungrateful, irreverent,

   ^3unfeeling, irreconcilable, slanderous, with no self-control, brutal,
   with no love for what is good,

   ^4treacherous, reckless, conceited, caring more for pleasure than for
   God,

   ^5keeping up the forms of religion, but resisting its influence. Avoid
   such people.

   ^6They are the kind of men who make their way into people's houses and
   make captives of poor, weak women, loaded down with their sins and
   under the control of all sorts of impulses,

   ^7always ready to learn but never able to comprehend the truth.

   ^8Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, these people in turn oppose
   the truth; they are men of depraved minds and counterfeit faith.

   ^9But they will not make much progress, for everyone will perceive
   their folly, just as they did that of those others.

   ^10But you have closely followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim, my
   faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,

   ^11my persecutions, my sufferings--the things that happened to me at
   Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the persecutions I endured; yet the Lord
   brought me safely out of them all.

   ^12But everyone who wants to live a godly life as a follower of Christ
   Jesus will be persecuted,

   ^13and bad men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving
   others and deceived themselves.

   ^14But you must stand by what you have learned and been convinced of,
   and remember from whom you learned it,

   ^15and how from childhood you have known the Scriptures which can give
   you the wisdom that through faith in Christ Jesus leads to salvation.

   ^16All Scripture is divinely inspired, and useful in teaching, in
   reproof, in correcting faults, and in training in uprightness,

   ^17so that the man of God will be adequate, and equipped for any good
   work.

   ^1I charge you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus who is to judge the
   living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom,

   ^2preach the message; be at it in season and out of season; convince,
   reprove, exhort people, with perfect patience and willingness to teach.

   ^3For a time will come when they will not listen to wholesome
   instruction, but will overwhelm themselves with teachers to suit their
   whims and tickle their fancies,

   ^4and they will turn from listening to the truth and wander off after
   fictions.

   ^5But you must always be composed; do not shrink from hardship; do your
   work as a missionary, and your whole duty as a minister.

   ^6My life is already being poured out, and the time has come for my
   departure.

   ^7I have had a part in the great contest, I have run my race, I have
   preserved my faith.

   ^8Now the crown of uprightness awaits me, which the Lord, the upright
   judge, will award me on that Day, and not only me but also all who have
   loved and hoped for his appearing.

   ^9Do your best to come to me soon,

   ^10for Demas has deserted me for love of the present world, and has
   gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to
   Dalmatia.

   ^11No one but Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he
   is of great assistance to me,

   ^12and I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

   ^13When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and
   the books, especially the parchments.

   ^14Alexander, the metal-worker, did me a great deal of harm. The Lord
   will repay him for what he did.

   ^15You too must be on your guard against him, for he vehemently opposed
   my teaching.

   ^16At my first appearance in court no one came to help me; everybody
   deserted me. May no one lay it up against them!

   ^17But the Lord stood by me, and gave me strength, so that I might make
   a full presentation of the message and let all the heathen hear it. So
   I was saved from the jaws of the lion.

   ^18The Lord will rescue me from any harm and bring me safely to his
   heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.

   ^19Remember me to Prisca and Aquila, and to the members of the
   household of Onesiphorus.

   ^20Erastus stayed in Corinth. I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.

   ^21Do your best to come before winter.

   Eubulus wishes to be remembered to you, and so do Pudens, Linus,
   Claudia, and all the brothers.

   ^22The Lord be with your spirit. God bless you all.

The Letter to Titus
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, a slave of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to arouse faith
   in those whom God has chosen, and the comprehension of religious truth,

   ^2in the hope of eternal life, which God who never lies promised ages
   ago,

   ^3and revealed at the proper time in his message, through the preaching
   with which I have been intrusted at the command of God our Savior,

   ^4to Titus, my true child in our common faith; God our Father and
   Christ Jesus our Savior bless you and give you peace.

   ^5I left you behind in Crete expressly to correct what defects there
   were, and to appoint elders in each town, as I directed you--

   ^6men of irreproachable character, who have been married only once,
   whose children are Christians, free from any suspicion of profligacy or
   disobedience.

   ^7For as God's overseer a superintendent must be irreproachable, not
   arrogant or quick-tempered or given to drink or pugnacious or addicted
   to dishonest gain,

   ^8but hospitable, a lover of goodness, sensible, upright, of holy life,
   self-controlled,

   ^9standing by the message that can be relied on, just as he was taught
   it, so that he may be qualified both to encourage others with wholesome
   teaching and to show the error of those who oppose him.

   ^10For there are many undisciplined people, who deceive themselves with
   their empty talk, especially those of the party of circumcision.

   ^11They must be silenced, for such men upset whole households by
   teaching things they ought not to teach, for the sake of dishonest
   gain.

   ^12It was a Cretan, a prophet of their own, who said,

   "Cretans are always liars, savage brutes, lazy gluttons,"

   ^13and that statement is true. Therefore correct them rigorously, to
   make them have a healthy faith,

   ^14and not study Jewish fictions or commands given by men who reject
   the truth.

   ^15To the pure everything is pure, but to the evil-minded and
   unbelieving nothing is pure, but their very minds and consciences are
   unclean.

   ^16They profess to know God, but they disown him by what they do; they
   are detestable, disobedient men, worthless for any good purpose.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1But you must teach people the things that properly belong to
   wholesome teaching.

   ^2Teach the older men to be temperate, serious, and sensible--men of
   vigorous faith, love, and steadfastness.

   ^3Teach the older women, too, to be reverent in their behavior, and not
   to gossip or be slaves of drink, but to be teachers of what is right,

   ^4so as to train the younger women to be loving wives and mothers,

   ^5and to be sensible, pure-minded, domestic, kind, and submissive to
   their husbands, so as not to bring reproach on God's message.

   ^6Urge the younger men, too, to be sensible.

   ^7In every way set them an example of good conduct yourself. Teach with
   sincerity and seriousness,

   ^8and present a wholesome, unobjectionable message, so that your
   opponent may be put to shame at finding nothing bad to say about us.

   ^9Tell slaves always to obey their masters and try to please them, not
   to oppose them

   ^10or steal from them, but to show such perfect good faith as to do
   credit to the teaching about God our Savior, by everything they do.

   ^11For God's mercy has appeared and brought salvation to all men,

   ^12training us to renounce godless ways and worldly passions, and live
   serious, upright, and godly lives in this world,

   ^13while we wait for the fulfilment of our blessed hope in the glorious
   appearing of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus.

   ^14He gave himself for us, to free us from all wickedness and purify
   for himself a people of his own, eager to do right.

   ^15This is what you must teach and urge and insist upon with full
   authority. No one is to look down on you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Remind men to accept and obey the constituted authorities, to be
   ready for any useful service,

   ^2to abuse nobody, to be peaceable and reasonable, showing perfect
   gentleness to everyone.

   ^3For we ourselves were once without understanding, disobedient,
   deluded, enslaved to all kinds of passions and pleasures. Our minds
   were full of malice and envy. Men hated us and we hated one another.

   ^4But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior were revealed,

   ^5he saved us, not for any upright actions we had performed, but from
   his own mercy, through the bath of regeneration and renewal by the holy
   Spirit,

   ^6which he has poured out upon us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
   Savior,

   ^7so that we might be made upright through his mercy and become
   possessors of eternal life in fulfilment of our hope.

   ^8This is a trustworthy teaching, and I want you to insist on these
   things, so that those who believe in God may make it their business to
   do good. All this is right and beneficial to mankind.

   ^9But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, pedigrees, strife,
   and wrangles about the Law, for they are profitless and futile.

   ^10If a man is inclined to a sect, after warning him once or twice,
   have nothing more to do with him.

   ^11You may be sure that a man of that kind is corrupt and sinful, for
   his own actions condemn him.

   ^12When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me
   at Nicopolis, for I have decided to settle there for the winter.

   ^13Do all you can to help Zenas the expert in the Law and Apollos on
   with their journey, and see that they have everything they need.

   ^14Have our people learn to make it their business to do good, so as to
   meet these pressing demands and not live unfruitful lives.

   ^15All who are with me wish to be remembered to you. Remember me to all
   believers who love me. God bless you all.

The Letter to Philemon
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Paul, a prisoner for Jesus Christ, and brother Timothy, to our dear
   fellow-worker Philemon,

   ^2and our sister Apphia, and our fellow-soldier Archippus, and the
   church that meets in your house;

   ^3God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you
   peace.

   ^4I never mention you in my prayers without thanking my God

   ^5for what I hear of the love and faith you have in the Lord Jesus and
   all his people,

   ^6and I pray that through coming to know every good thing about us as
   Christians they may effectually share your faith.

   ^7I have been greatly pleased and encouraged over your love, for the
   hearts of God's people have been cheered, my brother, by you.

   ^8So although as a Christian I feel quite free to order you to do what
   ought to be done,

   ^9I prefer to appeal to you in the name of love, simply as what I
   am--Paul, no less an envoy of Christ Jesus, though now a prisoner for
   him

   ^10I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whose father I have become
   here in prison.

   ^11Once you found him useless, but now he has become useful to you and
   to me,

   ^12and now that I send him back to you, it is like sending my very
   heart.

   ^13I would have liked to keep him with me, to wait on me in your place
   while I am in prison for the good news,

   ^14but I do not wish to do anything without your consent, so that your
   kindness might be voluntary, and not have the appearance of compulsion.

   ^15For perhaps this is why you and he were parted for a while, that you
   might have him back forever,

   ^16not as a slave any longer but more than a slave, a dear
   brother--dear especially to me, but how much dearer to you, both as a
   man and as a Christian!

   ^17So if you regard me as a comrade, welcome him as you would me.

   ^18And if he has caused you any loss or owes you anything, charge it to
   my account.

   ^19I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it--not to
   mention the fact that you owe me your very self besides.

   ^20Come, brother, let me make something out of you, in a Christian
   sense! Cheer my heart as a Christian.

   ^21I write you in full reliance upon your obedience; I know that you
   will do even more than I ask.

   ^22And get ready to entertain me too, for I hope that I shall be
   restored to you, in answer to your prayers.

   ^23Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner for Christ Jesus, wishes to be
   remembered to you,

   ^24and so do my fellow-workers, Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke.

   ^25The blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits.

The Letter to the Hebrews
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1It was little by little and in different ways that God spoke in old
   times to our forefathers through the prophets,

   ^2but in these latter days he has spoken to us in a Son, whom he had
   destined to possess everything, and through whom he had made the world.

   ^3He is the reflection of God's glory, and the representation of his
   being, and bears up the universe by his mighty word. He has effected
   man's purification from sin, and has taken his seat on high at the
   right hand of God's Majesty,

   ^4showing himself to be as much greater than the angels as his title is
   superior to theirs.

   ^5For to what angel did God ever say,

   "You are my Son! I have today become your Father"?

   Or again,

   "I will become his Father, and he shall become my Son"?

   ^6But of the time when he is to bring his firstborn Son back to the
   world he says,

   "And let all God's angels bow before him."

   ^7In speaking of the angels he says,

   "He who changes his angels into winds,

   And his attendants into blazing fire!"

   ^8But of the Son he says,

   "God is your throne forever and ever!

   And a righteous scepter is the scepter of his kingdom!

   ^9You have loved right and hated wrong!

   That is why God, your God, has anointed you with exhilarating oil
   beyond all your comrades."

   ^10And

   "You, Lord, in the beginning founded the earth,

   And the sky is the work of your hands!

   ^11They will perish, but you continue!

   And they will all wear out like a coat,

   ^12And you will fold them up like a mantle,

   And change them as one changes his coat.

   But you are always the same, and your years will have no end!"

   ^13But to what angel did he ever say,

   Sit at my right hand,

   Until I make your enemies a footstool for you"?

   ^14Are not the angels all spirits in service, whom he sends on his
   errands for the good of those who are destined to possess salvation?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1This is why we must give the very closest attention to the message we
   have heard, to keep from ever losing our hold upon it.

   ^2For if the message delivered by angels proved to be authentic, and
   every violation or neglect of it led to a corresponding penalty,

   ^3how can we escape if we pay no attention to such a salvation as this?
   It was first proclaimed by the Lord himself, and it was guaranteed to
   us by those who heard him,

   ^4while God himself corroborated their testimony with signs, portents,
   and various wonders, and by impartations of the holy Spirit when he saw
   fit.

   ^5For it was not for angels that he destined the control of that world
   to be, that we are speaking of.

   ^6For someone has somewhere solemnly declared,

   "What is man? for you think of him;

   Or any man? for you care for him.

   ^7You made him for a little while inferior to angels;

   Yet you have crowned him with glory and honor,

   And you have put him in charge of the works of your hands!

   ^8You have put everything under his feet!"

   In thus making everything subject to man, God left nothing that was not
   subjected to him. But we do not as yet see everything made subject to
   him,

   ^9but we do see Jesus, who was "made for a little while inferior to
   angels, crowned with glory and honor" because he suffered death, so
   that by the favor of God he might taste the bitterness of death on
   behalf of every human being.

   ^10For it was appropriate that he who is the great First Cause of the
   universe should, in guiding his many children to his glorious
   salvation, make their leader in it fully qualified through what he
   suffered.

   ^11For both he who purifies them and they who are purified spring from
   one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers,

   ^12and say,

   "I will tell your name to my brothers,

   In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise";

   ^13and again

   "I will put my trust in God";

   and again,

   "Here I am with the children that God has given me."

   ^14Therefore since these children referred to have the same mortal
   nature, Jesus also shared it, like them, in order that by his death he
   might dethrone the lord of death, the devil,

   ^15and free from their slavery men who had always lived in fear of
   death.

   ^16For of course it was not angels but the descendants of Abraham that
   he came to help.

   ^17And so he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that
   he might prove a compassionate high priest as well as one faithful in
   his service to God, in order to forgive the people's sins.

   ^18For because he has himself been tempted in what he has suffered he
   is able to help others who are in trial.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Therefore, my fellow-Christians, who have likewise heard the heavenly
   invitation, observe how faithful Jesus, the commissioner and high
   priest of our religion,

   ^2has been to the God who appointed him, just as Moses was, in all the
   house of God.

   ^3For Jesus is entitled to as much more honor than Moses as the builder
   of a house is than the house he builds.

   ^4For every house has a builder, and the builder of the universe is
   God.

   ^5Now the faithfulness of Moses in all the house of God was that of a
   servant, in faithfully repeating what he was told to say;

   ^6but Christ's faithfulness was that of a son set over the house of
   God. And we are that house, if we keep up our courage and our
   triumphant hope to the very end.

   ^7Therefore, as the holy Spirit says, "If you hear his voice today,

   ^8Do not harden your hearts as your forefathers provoked me by doing,

   As in that time of trial in the desert,

   ^9Where your forefathers put my doings to the proof for forty years,

   Though they saw them all the time.

   ^10That was why I was angry with that generation,

   And I said, Their minds are always wandering,

   And they have never found my paths.'

   ^11But as I made oath in my anger,

   They shall never be admitted to my Rest!"

   ^12See to it, my brothers, that no one of you has a wicked, unbelieving
   heart, that turns away from the ever-living God,

   ^13but encourage one another every day, as long as we can still speak
   of Today, so that no one of you may have his heart hardened by the
   pleasantness of sin.

   ^14For we are true partners with Christ if we really keep the
   conviction that we had at first unshaken to the very end.

   ^15So while we can still speak of Today, if you hear him speak, do not
   harden your hearts, as they provoked him by doing.

   ^16For who was it that heard him speak and yet provoked him? Was it not
   all those who had escaped from Egypt under Moses' leadership?

   ^17And who was it with whom God was angry forty whole years? Was it not
   with those who had sinned, who dropped dead in the desert?

   ^18And who was it to whom God made oath that they should not be
   admitted to his Rest, if it was not to those who had disobeyed him?

   ^19So we see that it was their unbelief that kept them from being
   admitted to it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1We ought therefore to fear that when the promise of admission to his
   Rest is still open, some one of you may be found to have failed to
   reach it.

   ^2For we have had good news preached to us, just as they did, but the
   message they heard did them no good because they did not agree through
   faith with what they heard.

   ^3For we who have believed are admitted to that Rest, of which he said,

   "As I made oath in my anger,

   They shall never be admitted to my Rest!"

   And yet God's work was finished at the creation of the world,

   ^4for he says somewhere of the seventh day,

   "On the seventh day God rested after all his work,"

   ^5while here he says again,

   "They shall never be admitted to my Rest!"

   ^6Since then it is still true that somebody will be admitted to it, and
   those who had a gospel preached to them before were not admitted
   because of their disobedience,

   ^7he again fixes a new Today, saying long afterward through David, as
   already quoted,

   "If you hear his voice today,

   Do not harden your hearts!"

   ^8For if Joshua had really brought them rest God would not afterward
   have spoken of another day.

   ^9So there must still be a promised Sabbath of Rest for God's people.

   ^10For all who are admitted to God's Rest rest after their work, just
   as God did after his.

   ^11Let us, therefore, make every effort to be admitted to that Rest, so
   that none of us may fail through such disobedience as theirs.

   ^12For the message of God is a living and active force, sharper than
   any double-edged sword, piercing through soul and spirit, and joints
   and marrow, and keen in judging the thoughts and purposes of the mind.

   ^13No being created can escape God's sight, but everything is bare and
   helpless before the eyes of him with whom we have to reckon.

   ^14Since then we have in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who
   has gone up into heaven, let us keep firm hold of our religion.

   ^15For our high priest is not one who is incapable of sympathy with our
   weaknesses, but he has been tempted in every way just as we have,
   without committing any sin.

   ^16So let us come with courage to God's throne of grace to receive his
   forgiveness and find him responsive when we need his help.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1For every high priest who is chosen from among men is appointed to
   represent his fellow-men in their relations with God, and to offer
   gifts and sin-offerings.

   ^2He can sympathize with the ignorant and misguided because he is
   himself subject to weakness,

   ^3and on this account he is obliged to offer sacrifices for sin, not
   only for the people but for himself as well.

   ^4And no one takes the office upon himself, but men assume it only when
   called to it by God, as Aaron was.

   ^5So even Christ did not claim for himself the dignity of the high
   priesthood, but he was appointed to it by him who said to him,

   "You are my Son! I have today become your Father!"

   ^6For he says in another passage,

   "You are a priest forever of the priesthood of Melchizedek."

   ^7For Jesus in his life on earth offered prayers and entreaties, crying
   aloud with tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and
   because of his piety his prayer was heard.

   ^8And although he was a son, he learned to obey, through what he
   suffered,

   ^9and when he was fully qualified, he became a source of unending
   salvation for all who obey him,

   ^10since God pronounced him a high priest of the priesthood of
   Melchizedek.

   ^11I have much to say to you about this, but it is difficult to make it
   clear to you, because you have become so slow of apprehension.

   ^12For although from the length of your Christian experience you ought
   to be teaching others, you actually need someone to teach you over
   again the very elements of Christian truth, and you have come to need
   milk instead of solid food.

   ^13For anyone who is limited to milk is unacquainted with Christian
   teaching, for he is only an infant.

   ^14But full-grown men have a right to solid food, for their faculties
   are trained by practice to distinguish right and wrong.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1Let us therefore leave elementary Christian teaching alone and
   advance toward maturity. We must not be always relaying foundations, of
   repentance for wrong-doing, and of faith in God,

   ^2with the teaching of baptism and the laying on of hands, the
   resurrection of the dead and final judgment.

   ^3And we will advance if God permits it.

   ^4For it is impossible to arouse people to a fresh repentance when they
   have once for all come into the light and had a taste of the gift from
   heaven, and shared in the holy Spirit

   ^5and felt the goodness of the word of God and the strong influences of
   the coming age,

   ^6and yet have fallen back, for they crucify the Son of God on their
   own account, and hold him up to contempt.

   ^7Ground that drinks in frequent showers and produces vegetation that
   is of use to those for whom it is cultivated receives God's blessing.

   ^8But if it yields thorns and thistles, it is thought worthless and
   almost cursed, and it will finally be burned.

   ^9But about you, dear friends, even though we say this, we are sure of
   better things that promise salvation.

   ^10For God is not so unjust as to forget the work you have done and the
   love you have showed for his cause, in giving help to your
   fellow-Christians as you still do.

   ^11But we want each of you to exhibit this same earnestness to the very
   end with regard to your confidence in your hope,

   ^12so that you may never grow careless, but may learn to follow the
   example of those who through their faith and endurance are the
   possessors of God's promises.

   ^13For when God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one
   greater for him to make oath by, he did so by himself,

   ^14and said,

   "I will certainly bless you richly, and greatly increase your numbers."

   ^15And so after waiting patiently, he received what God had promised
   him.

   ^16For men make oath by something greater than themselves, and they
   accept an oath as settling finally any disagreement they may have.

   ^17Therefore, God in his desire to make it perfectly clear to those to
   whom he made his promise, that his purpose was unalterable, bound
   himself with an oath,

   ^18so that by these two unalterable things, which make it impossible
   for God to break his promise, we who have taken refuge with him may be
   greatly encouraged to seize upon the hope that is offered to us.

   ^19This hope is like an anchor for our souls. It reaches up secure and
   strong into the sanctuary behind the heavenly curtain,

   ^20where Jesus has gone ahead of us, and become forever a high priest
   of the priesthood of Melchizedek.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1For this man Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High
   God, who met Abraham as he was on his way back from defeating the
   kings, and gave him his blessing,

   ^2to whom Abraham apportioned one tenth of all the spoil, who is first,
   as his name shows, king of righteousness and then king of Salem, which
   means king of peace--

   ^3with no father or mother or ancestry, and with no beginning to his
   days nor end to his life, but like no one but the Son of God, continues
   as priest forever.

   ^4Now see how great this man must have been to have the patriarch
   Abraham give him a tenth of the spoil.

   ^5Those of the descendants of Levi who are appointed to the priesthood
   are directed by the Law to collect tithes from the people, that is,
   from their own brothers, although they are descended from Abraham like
   themselves.

   ^6But this man, whose ancestry is not connected with theirs, collected
   tithes from Abraham himself, and gave his blessing to the man who had
   received the promises from God.

   ^7But, beyond any doubt, it is the inferior that is blessed by the
   superior.

   ^8In the one case, mortal men collect tithes; but in the other, one
   who, it is intimated, lives on.

   ^9In one way of putting it, Levi himself, the collector of the tithes,
   through Abraham paid him tithes,

   ^10for none of Abraham's posterity was yet begotten at the time of his
   meeting with Melchizedek.

   ^11Now if anything final had been really accomplished through the
   Levitical priesthood, for even the giving of the Law was based upon it,
   what further need would there have been of appointing a different
   priest of the priesthood of Melchizedek, instead of choosing one of the
   priesthood of Aaron?

   ^12For when there is a change in the priesthood, a change necessarily
   takes place in the Law as well.

   ^13For he of whom all this was said was related to a tribe no member of
   which ever officiated at the altar.

   ^14For it is perfectly clear that our Lord sprang from the tribe of
   Judah, with reference to which Moses said nothing at all about priests.

   ^15The point is still more clear in view of the fact that the
   appointment of the new priest resembles that of Melchizedek,

   ^16for he is appointed not for possessing any legal physical
   qualifications, but by virtue of a life that cannot end.

   ^17For the psalm bears witness,

   "You are a priest forever, of the priesthood of Melchizedek!"

   ^18So an earlier regulation is abrogated because it was poor and
   ineffective

   ^19(for there was nothing final about the Law), and a better hope
   begins to dawn, through which we may approach God.

   ^20And in proportion as Jesus was not appointed priest without God's
   making oath to it,

   ^21the agreement which he guarantees is better than the old one,

   ^22for God took no oath in appointing the old priests, but he made oath
   to his appointment, when he said to him,

   "The Lord has sworn it and he will not change;

   You are a priest forever!"

   ^23The old priests too had to be numerous, because death prevented
   their continuing in office.

   ^24But he continues forever, and so his priesthood is untransferable.

   ^25Therefore, he is able to save forever all who come to God through
   him, because he lives and intercedes for them forever.

   ^26Such a high priest we needed--godly, blameless, unstained, removed
   from sinful men and raised above the very heavens;

   ^27who does not need, as the old high priests did, to offer sacrifices
   every day, first for his own sins and then for those of the people--for
   this last he has done once for all, in offering up himself.

   ^28For the Law appoints to the high priesthood men full of
   imperfection; but this utterance about the making of the oath, which
   came long after the Law, appoints a son, fully qualified to be high
   priest forever.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1Now the main point in what I am saying is this: We have such a high
   priest as this, and he has taken his seat in heaven at the right hand
   of God's Majesty,

   ^2to officiate as priest in the sanctuary and in that true tent of
   worship which not man but the Lord himself set up.

   ^3But every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices, and
   so this high priest also must have some sacrifice to offer.

   ^4Further, if he were still on earth, he would not be a priest at all,
   for there are priests enough provided to offer the gifts the Law
   prescribes--

   ^5though the service they engage in is only a shadow and imitation of
   that in heaven. For when Moses was going to make the tent of worship he
   was warned, "Be sure to make it all just like the pattern you were
   shown on the mountain."

   ^6But, as it is, the priestly service to which Christ has been
   appointed is as much better than the old as the agreement established
   by him and the promises on which it is based are superior to the former
   ones.

   ^7For if that first agreement had been perfect, there would have been
   no occasion for a second one.

   ^8But in his dissatisfaction with them he says,

   " See! the time is coming,' says the Lord,

   When I will conclude a new agreement with the house of Israel and with
   the house of Judah,

   ^9Not like the one that I made with their forefathers,

   On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out from the land
   of Egypt,

   For they would not abide by their agreement with me,

   So I paid no attention to them,' says the Lord.

   ^10For this is the agreement that I will make with the house of Israel,

   In those later days,' says the Lord;

   I will put my laws into their minds,

   And write them on their hearts, And they will have me for their God,

   And I will have them for my people.

   ^11And they will not have to teach their townsmen and their brothers to
   know the Lord,

   For they will all know me,

   From the lowest to the highest.

   ^12For I will be merciful to their misdeeds,

   And I will no longer remember their sins.' "

   ^13Now when he speaks of a new agreement, he is treating the first one
   as obsolete; but whatever is obsolete and antiquated is almost ready to
   disappear.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   ^1Even the first agreement provided regulations for worship, and a
   sanctuary that was fully equipped.

   ^2For a tent was erected, with the lamp and the table and the
   presentation bread in the outer part, which was called the sanctuary.

   ^3And beyond the second curtain, in the part called the inner
   sanctuary,

   ^4stood the gold incense-altar and the chest that contained the
   agreement, entirely covered with gold, with the gold jar in it that
   held the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets
   containing the agreement;

   ^5and above the chest were the winged creatures of the Divine Presence
   overshadowing the lid on which the blood was sprinkled--of which I
   cannot now speak in detail.

   ^6With these arrangements for worship, the priests used constantly to
   go into the outer part of the tent, in the performance of their rites,

   ^7but only the high priest could enter the inner part, and he but once
   a year, and never without taking some victim's blood, to offer on his
   own behalf and for the sins committed through ignorance by the people.

   ^8In all this the holy Spirit was seeking to show that there was no
   free access to the sanctuary while the outer tent was still standing.

   ^9And all this looked toward the present time and was symbolic of the
   fact that the mere offering of material gifts and sacrifices cannot
   inwardly qualify the worshiper to approach God,

   ^10since they have to do only with food and drink and various
   washings--material regulations in force only until the time for the new
   order.

   ^11But when Christ came, as the high priest of the better system under
   which we live, he went once for all, through that greater, more perfect
   tent of worship not made by human hands nor a part of our material
   creation, into the sanctuary,

   ^12taking with him no blood of goats and calves, but his own, and
   secured our permanent deliverance.

   ^13For if sprinkling ceremonially defiled persons with the blood of
   bulls and goats and with the ashes of a heifer purifies them
   physically,

   ^14how much more surely will the blood of the Christ, who with the
   eternal Spirit made himself an unblemished offering to God, purify our
   consciences from the old wrongdoing for the worship of the everliving
   God?

   ^15And this is why he is the negotiator of a new agreement, in order
   that as someone has died to deliver them from the offenses committed
   under the old agreement, those who have been offered it may receive the
   unending inheritance they have been promised.

   ^16For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must
   be established,

   ^17for a will is valid only in the case of a person who is dead; it has
   no force as long as the testator is alive.

   ^18So even the old agreement could not be ratified without the use of
   blood.

   ^19For when Moses had told all the regulations of the Law to all the
   people, he took calves' and goats' blood, along with water, crimson
   wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled the roll of the Law and all
   the people,

   ^20saying, "This blood ratifies the agreement which God has commanded
   me to make with you."

   ^21The tent too and all the appliances used in the priestly service he
   sprinkled with blood in the same way.

   ^22In fact, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood,
   and unless blood is poured out nothing is forgiven.

   ^23By such means, therefore, these things that were only copied from
   the originals in heaven had to be purified, but the heavenly originals
   themselves required far better sacrifices than these.

   ^24For it was not a sanctuary made by human hands and only copied after
   the true one that Christ entered, but he went into heaven itself, in
   order to appear now on our behalf in the very presence of God.

   ^25Nor does he go in to offer himself over and over again, like the
   high priest who enters the sanctuary year after year, taking with him
   blood that is not his own,

   ^26for then he would have had to suffer death over and over, ever since
   the creation of the world. But, as it is, once for all at the close of
   the age he has appeared, to put an end to sin by his sacrifice.

   ^27And just as men are destined to die once and after that to be
   judged,

   ^28so the Christ too, after being offered in sacrifice once for all to
   carry away the sins of many, will appear again but without any burden
   of sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him to come and save them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 10

   ^1For while the Law foreshadowed the blessings that were to come, it
   did not fully express them, and so the priests by offering the same
   sacrifices endlessly year after year cannot wholly free those who come
   to worship from their sins.

   ^2Otherwise, would they not have ceased to offer these sacrifices,
   because those who offered them, having once been purified, would have
   had no further consciousness of sin?

   ^3They really only serve to remind the people annually of the sins they
   have committed,

   ^4for bulls' and goats' blood is powerless to remove sin.

   ^5That is why the Christ, when he was coming into the world, said,

   "You have not wished sacrifice or offering, but you have provided a
   body for me.

   ^6You never cared for burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin!

   ^7So I said, See, I have come! as the Book of the Law says of me,

   O God, to do your will!' "

   ^8At first he says, "You never wished or cared for sacrifices or
   offerings, or burnt-offerings or sacrifices for sin"--all of which the
   Law prescribes--

   ^9and then he adds, "See, I have come to do your will!" He is taking
   away the old to put the new in its place.

   ^10And it is through his doing of God's will that we have been once for
   all purified from sin through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
   in sacrifice.

   ^11Every other priest stands officiating day after day, offering over
   and over again the same sacrifices, though they were powerless ever to
   remove people's sins.

   ^12But Christ has offered for all time one sacrifice for sin, and has
   taken his seat at God's right hand,

   ^13from that time waiting for his enemies to be made his footstool.

   ^14For by that one sacrifice he has forever qualified those who are
   purified from sin to approach God.

   ^15And we have the testimony of the holy Spirit to this, for after
   saying,

   ^16" This is the agreement that I will make with them

   In those later days,' says the Lord,

   I will put my laws into their minds,

   And write them upon their hearts,' "

   he goes on,

   ^17" And their sins and their misdeeds I will no longer remember.' "

   ^18But when these are forgiven, there is no more need of offerings for
   sin.

   ^19Since then, brothers, we have free access to the sanctuary through
   the blood of Jesus,

   ^20by the new, living way which he has opened for us, through the
   curtain, that is, his physical nature,

   ^21and since in him we have a great priest set over the house of God,

   ^22let us draw near to God in sincerity of heart and with perfect
   faith, with our hearts cleansed from the sense of sin, and our bodies
   washed with clean water.

   ^23Let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we profess, for he who has
   given us his promise may be trusted.

   ^24By observing one another, let us arouse ourselves to rival one
   another's love and good deeds.

   ^25Let us not neglect meeting together as some do, but let us encourage
   one another, all the more as you can see that the great Day is coming
   nearer.

   ^26For if we choose to go on sinning after we have so fully learned the
   truth, there is no sacrifice left to be offered for our sins,

   ^27but only the dreadful prospect of judgment and that blazing
   indignation which is to devour God's enemies.

   ^28Anyone who breaks the Law of Moses is put to death without any show
   of pity, on the evidence of only two or three witnesses.

   ^29How much worse a punishment do you think will anyone deserve who
   tramples the Son of God underfoot, and treats as worthless the blood of
   the agreement by which he has been purified, and outrages God's spirit
   of mercy?

   ^30For we know who it is that has said,

   "Vengeance belongs to me! I will pay back!"

   and in another place,

   "The Lord will be the judge of his people!"

   ^31It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!

   ^32But you must remember those early days when after you had received
   the light you had to go through a great struggle with persecution,

   ^33sometimes being actually exposed as a public spectacle to insults
   and violence, and sometimes showing yourselves ready to share the lot
   of those in that condition.

   ^34For you showed sympathy with those who were in prison, and you put
   up with it cheerfully when your property was taken from you, for you
   knew that you had in yourselves a greater possession that was lasting.

   ^35You must not lose your courage, for it will be richly rewarded,

   ^36but you will need endurance if you are to carry out God's will and
   receive the blessing he has promised.

   ^37For

   "In a very little while

   He who is to come will come and not delay,

   ^38And he whom I accept as righteous will find life through his faith.

   But if a man draws back, my heart can take no pleasure in him."

   ^39But we will not draw back and perish, but we will have faith and
   save our souls.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1Faith means the assurance of what we hope for; it is our conviction
   about things that we cannot see.

   ^2For it was by it that the men of old gained God's approval.

   ^3It is faith that enables us to see that the universe was created at
   the command of God, so that the world we see did not simply arise out
   of matter.

   ^4Faith made Abel's sacrifice greater in the sight of God than Cain's;
   through faith he gained God's approval as an upright man, for God
   himself approved his offering, and through faith even when he was dead
   he still spoke.

   ^5Faith caused Enoch to be taken up from the earth without experiencing
   death; he could not be found, because God had taken him up. For before
   he was taken up there is evidence that he pleased God,

   ^6but without faith it is impossible to please him; for whoever would
   approach God must have faith in his existence and in his willingness to
   reward those who try to find him.

   ^7Faith led Noah, when he was warned by God of things no one then saw,
   in obedience to the warning to build an ark in which to save his
   family, and by such faith he condemned the world, and came to possess
   that uprightness which faith produces.

   ^8Faith enabled Abraham to obey when God summoned him to leave his home
   for a region which he was to have for his own, and to leave home
   without knowing where he was going.

   ^9Faith led him to make a temporary home as a stranger in the land he
   had been promised, and to live there in his tents, with Isaac and
   Jacob, who shared the promise with him.

   ^10For he was looking forward to that city with the sure foundations,
   designed and built by God.

   ^11Faith made even Sarah herself able to have a child, although she was
   past the time of life for it, because she thought, that he who had made
   the promise would keep it.

   ^12And so from one man, for any prospect of descendants as good as
   dead, there sprang a people in number like the stars in the heavens or
   the countless sands on the seashore.

   ^13All these people lived all their lives in faith, and died without
   receiving what had been promised; they only saw it far ahead and
   welcomed the sight of it, recognizing that they themselves were only
   foreigners and strangers here on earth.

   ^14For men who recognize that show that they are in search of a country
   of their own.

   ^15And if it had been the country from which they had come to which
   their thoughts turned back, they would have found an opportunity to
   return to it.

   ^16But, as it is, their aspirations are for a better, a heavenly
   country! That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he
   has prepared a city to receive them.

   ^17Faith enabled Abraham, when he was put to the test, to offer Isaac
   as a sacrifice. He who had accepted God's promises was ready to
   sacrifice his only son,

   ^18of whom he had been told, "Your posterity is to arise through
   Isaac!"

   ^19For he believed that God was able to raise men even from the dead,
   and from the dead he did indeed, to speak figuratively, receive him
   back.

   ^20Faith enabled Isaac to bequeath to Jacob and Esau blessings that
   were still to be.

   ^21Faith made Jacob when he was dying give a blessing to each of
   Joseph's sons, and bow in worship even while leaning on his staff.

   ^22Faith inspired Joseph when he was dying to tell of the future
   migration of the Israelites, and to give instructions about his own
   body.

   ^23Faith led Moses' parents to hide him for three months after his
   birth, because they saw that he was a beautiful child and they would
   not respect the edict of the king.

   ^24Faith made Moses, when he was grown up, refuse to be known as a son
   of Pharaoh's daughter,

   ^25for he preferred sharing the hardships of God's people to a
   short-lived enjoyment of sin,

   ^26and thought such contempt as the Christ endured was truer wealth
   than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking forward to the coming
   reward.

   ^27Faith made him leave Egypt, unafraid of the king's anger, for he
   persevered as though he saw him who is unseen.

   ^28Faith made him institute the Passover and splash the blood upon the
   door-posts, to keep the angel that destroyed the firstborn from
   touching them.

   ^29Faith enabled them to cross the Red Sea as though it were dry land,
   although the Egyptians when they tried to follow them across it were
   drowned.

   ^30Faith made the walls of Jericho fall, after they had marched around
   them each day for seven days.

   ^31Faith saved Rahab the prostitute from being destroyed with those who
   disobeyed God, because she had given a friendly welcome to the scouts.

   ^32And why should I go on? For my time would fail me if I told of
   Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets,

   ^33who by their faith conquered kingdoms, attained uprightness,
   received new promises, shut the mouths of lions,

   ^34put out furious fires, escaped death by the sword, found strength in
   their time of weakness, proved mighty in war, put foreign armies to
   flight.

   ^35Women had their dead restored to them by resurrection. Others
   endured torture, and refused to accept release, that they might rise
   again to the better life.

   ^36Still others had to endure taunts and blows, and even fetters and
   prison.

   ^37They were stoned to death, they were tortured to death, they were
   sawed in two, they were killed with the sword. Clothed in the skins of
   sheep or goats, they were driven from place to place, destitute,
   persecuted, misused--

   ^38men of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts,
   mountains, caves, and holes in the ground.

   ^39Yet though they all gained God's approval by their faith, they none
   of them received what he had promised,

   ^40for God had resolved upon something still better for us, that they
   might not reach the fulfilment of their hopes except with us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1Therefore, let us too, with such a crowd of witnesses about us, throw
   off every impediment and the entanglement of sin, and run with
   determination the race for which we are entered,

   ^2fixing our eyes upon Jesus, our leader and example in faith, who in
   place of the happiness that belonged to him, submitted to a cross,
   caring nothing for its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand
   of the throne of God.

   ^3Think of the opposition that he encountered from those sinners
   against themselves, if you would not grow weary and faint-hearted.

   ^4You have not yet resisted unto death in your struggle with sin,

   ^5and you have forgotten the challenge addressed to you as God's sons,

   "My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline,

   Or give up when he corrects you.

   ^6For it is those whom the Lord loves that he disciplines,

   And he chastises every son that he acknowledges."

   ^7You must submit to it as discipline. God is dealing with you as his
   sons. For where is there a son whom his father does not discipline?

   ^8But if you have none of that discipline which all sons undergo, you
   are illegitimate children, and not true sons.

   ^9When our earthly fathers disciplined us we treated them with respect;
   should we not far more submit to the Father of our spirits, and so have
   life?

   ^10For they disciplined us for a short time and as they thought proper,
   but he does it for our good, to make us share his holiness.

   ^11Discipline is never pleasant at the time; it is painful; but to
   those who are trained by it, it afterward yields the peace of
   character.

   ^12So tighten your loosening hold! Stiffen your wavering stand!

   ^13And keep your feet in straight paths, so that limbs that are lame
   may not be dislocated but instead be cured.

   ^14Try to be at peace with everyone, and strive for that consecration
   without which no one can see the Lord.

   ^15Be careful that no one fails to gain God's favor, or some poisonous
   root may come up to trouble and contaminate you all--

   ^16some immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his very
   birthright for one single meal.

   ^17For you know how, when he afterward wished to claim the blessing, he
   was refused it, although he begged for it with tears, for he had no
   opportunity to repent of what he had done.

   ^18For it is no tangible blazing fire that you have come up to, no
   blackness and darkness and storm,

   ^19no trumpet blast and voice whose words made those who heard them beg
   to be told no more,

   ^20for they could not bear the order, "Even a wild animal, if it
   touches the mountain, must be stoned to death,"

   ^21and so awful was the sight that Moses said, "I am aghast and
   appalled!"

   ^22But you have come up to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God,
   the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless angels,

   ^23to the solemn gathering of all God's elder sons, enrolled as
   citizens in heaven, to a judge who is the God of all, to the spirits of
   upright men now at last enjoying the fulfilment of their hopes,

   ^24to Jesus the negotiator of a new agreement, and to sprinkled blood
   that speaks more powerfully than even Abel's.

   ^25Take care not to refuse to listen to him who is speaking. For if
   they could not escape because they would not listen to him who warned
   them here on earth, how much less can we, who reject him who is from
   heaven!

   ^26Then his voice shook the earth, but now his promise is, "But once
   more I will make not only the earth but the very heaven to tremble!"

   ^27Now the words "But once more" indicate the final removal of all that
   is shaken, as only created, leaving only what is unshaken to be
   permanent.

   ^28Let us, therefore, be thankful that the kingdom given to us cannot
   be shaken, and so please God by worshiping him with reverence and awe;

   ^29for our God is a consuming fire.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   ^1Your love for the brotherhood must continue.

   ^2Do not forget to be hospitable to strangers, for by being so some,
   without knowing it, have had angels as their guests.

   ^3Remember those who are in prison as though you were in prison with
   them, and those who are ill-treated as being yourselves liable to the
   same trials.

   ^4Marriage should be respected by everyone, and the marriage relation
   kept sacred, for vicious and immoral people God will punish.

   ^5You must not be avaricious; you must be content with what you have,
   for God himself has said, "I will never let go of you or desert you!"

   ^6So that we can confidently say,

   "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.

   What can men do to me?"

   ^7Do not forget your former leaders, the men who brought you God's
   message. Remember how they ended their lives and imitate their faith.

   ^8Jesus Christ is the same today that he was yesterday, and he will be
   so forever.

   ^9You must not be carried away with strange varieties of teaching. The
   true way to steadfastness of heart is through God's mercy, not through
   scruples about food, which have never done their adherents any good.

   ^10Our altar is one at which those who serve the tent of worship have
   no right to eat.

   ^11For the bodies of the animals whose blood is taken into the
   sanctuary by the high priest are burned outside the camp.

   ^12And so Jesus too, in order to purify the people by his blood,
   suffered death outside the city gate.

   ^13Let us, therefore, go out to him, outside the camp, sharing the
   contempt that he endured,

   ^14for we have no permanent city here on earth, but we are in search of
   the city that is to come.

   ^15In his name let us continually offer praise as our sacrifice to
   God--the utterance of lips that glorify God's name.

   ^16But do not forget to be helpful and generous, for that is the kind
   of sacrifice that pleases God.

   ^17Obey your leaders and give way to them, for they are keeping watch
   in defense of your souls, as men accountable for the trust. Make their
   work a joy and not a grief, for that would be the worse for you.

   ^18Pray for me, for I am sure I have a clear conscience, and I mean in
   every way to live an upright life.

   ^19I ask this of you more especially that I may be brought back to you
   the sooner.

   ^20May God, the giver of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord
   Jesus who through the blood by which he ratified the everlasting
   agreement has become the great shepherd of the sheep,

   ^21fit you by every blessing to do his will, and through Jesus Christ
   carry out in us what will please him. To him be glory forever and ever.
   Amen.

   ^22I beg you brothers, to listen patiently to this appeal, for I have
   written you but briefly.

   ^23You must know that our brother Timothy has been released from
   prison. If he comes here soon, we will see you together.

   ^24Remember us to all your leaders and to all your fellow-Christians.
   The brothers from Italy wish to be remembered to you.

   ^25God bless you all!

The Letter to James
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends greeting to
   the twelve tribes that are scattered over the world.

   ^2You must find the greatest joy, my brothers, in being involved in
   various trials,

   ^3for you know that the testing of your faith leads to steadfastness,

   ^4and steadfastness must have full play, so that you may be fully and
   perfectly developed without any defects.

   ^5If any one of you is deficient in wisdom, let him ask God who gives
   generously to everyone, and does not reproach one with it afterward,
   and he will give it to him.

   ^6But he must ask with faith, and without any doubt, for the man who
   doubts is like the billowing sea, driven and blown about by the wind.

   ^7Such a man must not expect to get anything from the Lord--

   ^8an irresolute person like him, who is uncertain about everything he
   does.

   ^9A brother of low position ought to be proud of his eminence,

   ^10but one who is rich ought to rejoice at being reduced in
   circumstances, for the rich will disappear like the wild flowers.

   ^11For the sun comes up with its scorching heat and dries up the grass,
   and the flowers wither, and all their beauty is gone. That is the way
   rich men will fade and die in the midst of their pursuits.

   ^12Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he stands the test,
   he will be given the crown of life, which God has promised to those who
   love him.

   ^13No one should think when he is tempted that his temptation comes
   from God, for God is incapable of being tempted by what is evil, and he
   does not tempt anyone.

   ^14When anyone is tempted, it is by his own desire that he is enticed
   and allured.

   ^15Then desire conceives and gives birth to sin, and when sin is
   mature, it brings forth death.

   ^16Do not be misled, my dear brothers.

   ^17Every good gift and every perfect present is from heaven, and comes
   down from the Father of the heavenly lights, about whom there is no
   variation of changing shadow.

   ^18Of his own accord he brought us into being through the message of
   truth, so that we might be a kind of first-fruits among his creatures.

   ^19You must understand this, my dear brothers. Everyone must be quick
   to hear, slow to speak, slow to be angry,

   ^20for men's anger does not produce the uprightness God wishes.

   ^21So strip yourselves of everything that soils you, and of every evil
   growth, and in a humble spirit let the message that has the power to
   save your souls be planted in your hearts.

   ^22Obey the message; do not merely listen to it, and deceive
   yourselves.

   ^23For anyone who merely listens to the message without obeying it is
   like a man who looks in a mirror at the face that nature gave him,

   ^24and then goes off and immediately forgets what he looked like.

   ^25But whoever looks at the faultless law that makes men free and keeps
   looking, so that he does not just listen and forget, but obeys and acts
   upon it, will be blessed in what he does.

   ^26If anyone thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue,
   but deceives himself, his religious observances are of no account.

   ^27A religious observance that is pure and stainless in the sight of
   God the Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their
   trouble, and keep one's self unstained by the world.

  Chapter 2

   ^1My brothers, do you try to combine faith in our glorious Lord Jesus
   Christ with acts of partiality?

   ^2For if a finely dressed man with a gold ring comes into a meeting,
   and a poor man in shabby clothes comes in also,

   ^3and you pay attention to the man in the fine clothes and say to him,
   "Sit here; this is a good place!" and say to the poor man, "Stand up,
   or sit on the floor at my feet,"

   ^4have you not wavered and shown that your judgments are guided by base
   motives?

   ^5Listen, my dear brothers. Has not God chosen the world's poor to be
   rich in faith, and to possess the kingdom that he promised to those who
   love him?

   ^6But you humiliate the poor. Are not the rich your oppressors? Is it
   not they who drag you into court?

   ^7Is it not they who slander the noble name you bear?

   ^8If you really obey the supreme law where the Scripture says, "You
   must love your neighbor as you do yourself," you are doing right,

   ^9but if you show partiality, you are committing a sin, and stand
   convicted before the Law as lawbreakers.

   ^10For anyone who obeys the whole of the Law but makes one single slip
   is guilty of breaking it all.

   ^11For he who said, "You must not commit adultery," said also, "You
   must not commit murder." Now if you abstain from adultery, but commit
   murder, you are still a violator of the Law.

   ^12You must talk and act like men who expect to be judged by the law
   that treats men as free.

   ^13For the merciless will be mercilessly judged; but mercy will triumph
   over judgment.

   ^14My brothers, what is the good of a man's saying he has faith, if he
   has no good deeds to show? Can faith save him?

   ^15If some brother or sister has no clothes and has not food enough for
   a day,

   ^16and one of you says to them, "Goodbye, keep warm and have plenty to
   eat," without giving them the necessaries of life, what good does it
   do?

   ^17So faith by itself, if it has no good deeds to show, is dead.

   ^18But someone may say, "You have faith, and I good deeds." Show me
   your faith without any good deeds, and I will show you my faith by my
   good deeds.

   ^19Do you believe in one God? Very well! So do the demons, and they
   shudder.

   ^20But do you want proof, my senseless friend, that faith without good
   deeds amounts to nothing?

   ^21Was not our forefather Abraham made upright for his good deeds, for
   offering his son Isaac on the altar?

   ^22You see that in his case faith and good deeds worked together; faith
   found its highest expression in good deeds,

   ^23and so the Scripture came true that says, "Abraham had faith in God,
   and it was credited to him as uprightness, and he was called God's
   friend."

   ^24You see a man is made upright by his good deeds and not simply by
   having faith.

   ^25Was not even Rahab the prostitute made upright for her good deeds,
   in entertaining the scouts and sending them off by a different road?

   ^26Just as the body without the spirit is dead, faith is dead without
   good deeds.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know
   that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.

   ^2For we all make many mistakes. Anyone who never makes a mistake in
   what he says has a character that is fully developed and is able to
   control his whole body as well.

   ^3If we put bridles into horses' mouths to make them obey us, we can
   guide their whole bodies.

   ^4Even ships, great as they are, and driven by strong winds, are
   steered with a very small rudder wherever the pilot pleases.

   ^5So the tongue is a little organ and yet very boastful. What a great
   forest a spark will set on fire!

   ^6And the tongue is a fire, a world of wrong the tongue proves in our
   bodies, soiling the whole body and setting fire to the whole round of
   nature, and set on fire itself by hell.

   ^7For every kind of animal and bird, reptile and sea creature, can be
   tamed and has been tamed by man,

   ^8but no human being can tame the tongue. It is an irreconcilable evil,
   full of deadly poison.

   ^9With it we bless the Lord our Father, and with it we curse men made
   in God's likeness.

   ^10Blessing and cursing issue from the same mouth! This is not right,
   my brothers.

   ^11Does a spring pour forth fresh and brackish water from the same
   crevice?

   ^12Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers, or a grape vine figs? A
   salt spring cannot give fresh water.

   ^13What wise, intelligent man is there among you? Let him show by his
   good life that what he does is done in the humility of wisdom.

   ^14But if you cherish bitter feelings of jealousy and rivalry in your
   hearts, do not pride yourselves on it and thus belie the truth.

   ^15Such wisdom does not come from above. It is earthly, animal,
   demon-like.

   ^16For wherever jealousy and rivalry exist, there will be confusion and
   every low action.

   ^17The wisdom that is from above is first of all pure, then peaceable,
   considerate, willing to yield, full of compassion and good deeds,
   whole-hearted, straightforward.

   ^18The harvest uprightness yields must be sown in peace, by
   peacemakers.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1What causes wars and fights among you? Is it not your cravings, which
   are at war within your bodies?

   ^2You crave things, and cannot have them, and so you commit murder. You
   covet things, and cannot get them, and so you quarrel and fight. You do
   not have things because you do not ask for them.

   ^3You ask and fail to get them because you ask with wrong motives, to
   spend them on your pleasures.

   ^4You renegades! Do you not know that the friendship of the world means
   enmity with God? So whoever wishes to be the world's friend declares
   himself God's enemy.

   ^5Do you suppose the Scripture means nothing when it says, "He yearns
   jealously over the Spirit he has put in our hearts?"

   ^6But he gives all the greater blessing. As the Scripture says, "God
   opposes haughty persons, but he blesses humble-minded ones."

   ^7Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil and he will fly from you.

   ^8Approach God, and he will approach you. Wash your hands, you sinners!
   Make your hearts pure, you doubters!

   ^9Be miserable, grieve, and weep aloud! Turn your laughter into grief
   and your happiness into gloom.

   ^10Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will raise you up

   ^11Do not talk against one another, brothers. Whoever talks against a
   brother or condemns his brother talks against the Law, and condemns the
   Law. But if you condemn the Law you are not an observer of the Law but
   its judge.

   ^12There is only one lawgiver and judge--he who has the power to save
   and to destroy; who are you, to judge your neighbor?

   ^13Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we are going to such and
   such a town, to stay a year and go into business and make money,"

   ^14when you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! You are
   just a mist, which appears for a little while and then disappears.

   ^15This, instead of saying, "If it is the Lord's will, we shall live to
   do this or that."

   ^16But, as it is, you pride yourselves on your pretensions. All such
   pride is wrong.

   ^17So when a man knows what is right and fails to do it, he is guilty
   of sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1Come now, you rich people! weep aloud and howl over the miseries that
   are going to overtake you!

   ^2Your wealth has rotted, your clothes are moth-eaten,

   ^3your gold and silver are rusted, and their rust will testify against
   you and eat into your very flesh, for you have stored up fire for the
   last days.

   ^4Why, the wages you have withheld from the laborers who have reaped
   your harvests cry aloud, and the cries of the harvesters have reached
   the ears of the Lord of Hosts.

   ^5You have lived luxuriously and voluptuously here on earth; you have
   fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.

   ^6You have condemned and murdered the upright. Will he make no
   resistance?

   ^7So be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer has
   to wait for the precious crop from the ground, and be patient with it,
   until it gets the early and the late rains.

   ^8You must have patience too; you must keep up your courage, for the
   coming of the Lord is close at hand.

   ^9Do not complain of one another, brothers, or you will be judged. The
   judge is standing right at the door!

   ^10As an example, brothers, of ill-treatment patiently endured, take
   the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord.

   ^11Why, we call those who showed such endurance happy! You have heard
   of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen what the Lord brought
   out of it, for the Lord is very kind and merciful.

   ^12Above all, my brothers, do not swear an oath, either by heaven or by
   the earth, or by anything else; let your "Yes" be a plain Yes, and your
   "No" a plain No, or you will fall under condemnation.

   ^13If any one of you is in trouble, he should pray. If any one is in
   good spirits, he should sing a hymn.

   ^14If any one is sick, he should call in the elders of the church and
   have them pray over him, and pour oil on him in the name of the Lord,

   ^15and the prayer offered in faith will save the sick man; the Lord
   will restore him to health, and if he has committed sins, he will be
   forgiven.

   ^16So confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so
   that you may be cured. An upright man can do a great deal by prayer
   when he tries.

   ^17Elijah was a man like us, and he prayed earnestly that it might not
   rain, and for three years and six months there was no rain in the land.

   ^18Then he prayed again, and the heavens yielded rain and the earth
   produced crops.

   ^19My brothers, if any one of you is led astray from the truth, and
   someone brings him back,

   ^20you may be sure that whoever brings a sinner back from his misguided
   way will save the man's soul from death, and cover up a host of sins.

The First Letter of Peter
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who are scattered as
   foreigners over Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

   ^2whom God the Father has chosen and predestined by the consecration of
   the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ, and to be sprinkled with his
   blood; God bless you and give you perfect peace.

   ^3Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great
   mercy he has caused us to be born anew to a life of hope through Jesus
   Christ's resurrection from the dead,

   ^4and to an imperishable, unsullied, and unfading inheritance, which is
   kept safe for you in heaven,

   ^5and you by God's power are being protected through faith to receive a
   salvation that is now ready to be disclosed at the last time.

   ^6Rejoice over this, although just now perhaps distressed by various
   trials;

   ^7they are to show that your faith when tested is found to be more
   precious than gold, which though it is perishable is tested with fire,
   and they will bring you praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is
   revealed.

   ^8You must love him, though you have not seen him, but since you
   believe in him though you do not now see him, rejoice with triumphant,
   unutterable joy

   ^9to attain the goal of faith, the salvation of your souls.

   ^10About this salvation the prophets who prophesied of the blessing
   that was destined for you made the most careful investigation,

   ^11trying to learn for what possible time the spirit of Christ within
   them in predicting the sufferings destined for Christ intended them and
   the glories that were to follow them.

   ^12It was disclosed to them that they were serving not themselves but
   you in dealing with these things, which have now been told you by those
   who through the holy Spirit sent from heaven brought you the good news;
   things into which angels long to look!

   ^13Therefore, prepare your minds for action, and with perfect calmness
   fix your hopes on the mercy that you are to experience when Jesus
   Christ is revealed.

   ^14Like obedient children, do not adapt yourselves to the cravings you
   used to follow when you were ignorant,

   ^15but like the holy Being who has called you, you must also prove holy
   in all your conduct,

   ^16for the Scripture says,

   "You must be holy,

   Because I am holy."

   ^17And if you address him as Father who judges everyone impartially by
   what he does, you must live reverently all the time you stay here,

   ^18for you know that you have not been ransomed with anything
   perishable like silver or gold, from the futile way of living in which
   you were brought up,

   ^19but with precious blood, like that of an unblemished, spotless lamb,
   the blood of Christ,

   ^20who was predestined for this before the foundation of the world, but
   was revealed only at the end of the ages,

   ^21for the sake of you who through him trust in God, who raised him
   from the dead and showed him honor; and so your faith and hope rest on
   God.

   ^22Now that by obeying the truth you have purified your souls for
   sincere love of the brotherhood, you must love one another intensely
   and heartily,

   ^23for you have been born anew from a germ not perishable, but
   imperishable, through the message of the living, everlasting God.

   ^24For

   "All flesh is like grass,

   And all its glory like the flower of the grass.

   The grass withers,

   And the flower fades,

   ^25But the word of the Lord will last forever,"

   that is, the good news that has been brought to you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1Free yourselves, therefore, from all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy,
   and slander of any kind,

   ^2and like new-born babes crave the pure spiritual milk that will make
   you grow up to salvation,

   ^3since you have tasted the Lord's kindness.

   ^4Come to him, as to a living stone rejected by men, but chosen and
   prized in the sight of God,

   ^5and build yourselves up as living stones into a spiritual house for a
   consecrated priesthood, so as to offer spiritual sacrifices that
   through Jesus Christ will be acceptable to God.

   ^6For it says in Scripture,

   "Here I lay a choice stone in Zion, a costly cornerstone;

   No one who believes in it will ever be disappointed!"

   ^7It is you, therefore, who believe who see its value, but for men who
   do not believe,

   "The stone which the builders refused has been made a cornerstone,"

   ^8and

   "A stone to stumble over, and a rock to trip them up."

   They stumble over the message because they will not obey it; that is
   their destiny.

   ^9But you are the chosen race, the royal priesthood, the consecrated
   nation, his own people, so that you may declare the virtues of him who
   has called you out of darkness into his wonderful light;

   ^10you who were once "no people" but are now "God's people"; once
   "unpitied" but now "pitied indeed."

   ^11Dear friends, I beg you, as aliens and exiles here, not to indulge
   the physical cravings that are at war with the soul.

   ^12Live upright lives among the heathen, so that even if they charge
   you with being evil-doers, they may from observing the uprightness of
   your conduct come to praise God on the Day of Judgment.

   ^13Submit to all human authority, for the Master's sake; to the
   emperor, as supreme,

   ^14and to governors, as sent by him to punish evil-doers, and to
   encourage those who do right.

   ^15For it is the will of God that by doing right you should silence the
   ignorant charges of foolish people.

   ^16Live like free men, only do not make your freedom an excuse for
   doing wrong, but be slaves of God.

   ^17Treat everyone with respect. Love the brotherhood, be reverent to
   God, respect the emperor.

   ^18You servants must be submissive to your masters and perfectly
   respectful to them; not only to those who are kind and considerate, but
   also to those who are unreasonable.

   ^19For God approves a man if from a sense of duty he endures suffering
   unjustly inflicted--

   ^20for what credit is there in your enduring being beaten for doing
   wrong? But if you endure suffering for doing what is right, you have
   God's approval.

   ^21That is the life to which you have been called, for Christ himself
   suffered for you, leaving you an example so that you might follow his
   footsteps.

   ^22He committed no sin, and deceit was never on his lips.

   ^23He was abused but he did not retort. He suffered but he did not
   threaten, but committed his case to him who judges justly.

   ^24He carried the burden of our sins in his own body on the cross, in
   order that we might die to sin and live for uprightness. By his wounds
   you have been healed.

   ^25For you were astray like sheep, but now you have returned to the
   shepherd and guardian of your souls.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1You married women, in the same way, must be submissive to your
   husbands, so that any who refuse to believe the message may be won over
   without argument through the behavior of their wives

   ^2when they see how chaste and submissive you are.

   ^3You must not adopt the external attractions of arranging the hair and
   wearing jewelry and dress;

   ^4yours must be the inner beauty of character, the imperishable
   attraction of a quiet and gentle spirit, which has great value in the
   sight of God.

   ^5It was in that way in ancient times that those pious women who set
   their hopes on God made themselves attractive. They were submissive to
   their husbands,

   ^6like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham, and called him Master. You are true
   daughters of hers, if you do right and are unafraid.

   ^7You married men also must be considerate in living with your wives.
   You must show deference to women as the weaker sex, sharing the gift of
   life with you, so that there may be nothing to interfere with your
   prayers.

   ^8Finally, you must all be harmonious, sympathizing, loving,
   tender-hearted, modest,

   ^9not returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse. You must bless
   people instead. It is for this that you were called--to obtain
   blessing.

   ^10For

   "Let him who would enjoy life

   And see happy days,

   Keep his tongue from evil,

   And his lips from uttering deceit.

   ^11Let him turn away from evil and do right,

   Let him seek peace and go after it.

   ^12For the eyes of the Lord are upon upright men,

   And his ears are open to their entreaty,

   But the Lord's face is set against men that do wrong."

   ^13And who is there that can hurt you if you are eager to do what is
   right?

   ^14Even if you should suffer for uprightness, you are blessed. But do
   not be afraid of them, nor be troubled,

   ^15but reverence Christ in your hearts as Lord, and always be ready to
   make your defense to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that
   you have. But do so gently and respectfully,

   ^16and keep your conscience clear, so that those who abuse your upright
   Christian conduct may be made ashamed of their slanders.

   ^17For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's
   will, than for doing wrong.

   ^18For Christ himself died once for all, for sin, an upright man for
   unrighteous men, to bring us to God, and was physically put to death,
   but he was made alive in the Spirit.

   ^19In it Enoch went and preached even to those spirits that were in
   prison,

   ^20who had once been disobedient, when in Noah's time God in his
   patience waited for the ark to be made ready, in which a few people,
   eight in all, were brought safely through the water.

   ^21Baptism, which corresponds to it, now saves you also (not as the
   mere removing of physical stain, but as the craving for a conscience
   right with God)--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

   ^22who has gone to heaven and is at God's right hand, with angels,
   hierarchies, and powers made subject to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1Since Christ therefore has suffered in our physical nature, you must
   also arm yourselves with the same resolve. For he who suffers in his
   physical nature has done with sin,

   ^2and no longer lives by what men desire, but for the rest of his
   earthly life by what God wills.

   ^3You have spent time enough in the past in doing as the heathen like
   to do, indulging in sensuality, passion, drunkenness, carousing,
   dissipation, and detestable idolatry.

   ^4They are amazed that you no longer join them in plunging into the
   flood of dissipation, and they abuse you for it;

   ^5but they will have to answer for it to him who is ready to judge
   living and dead.

   ^6This is why the good news was preached to the dead also, that though
   they are judged in their physical nature as men are, they may yet live,
   like God, in the Spirit.

   ^7But the end of all things is near. Be serious and collected,
   therefore, and pray.

   ^8Above all keep your love for one another strong, because love covers
   up a host of sins.

   ^9Be ungrudgingly hospitable to one another.

   ^10Whatever the endowment God has given you, use it in service to one
   another, like good dispensers of God's varied mercy.

   ^11If one preaches, let him do it like one who utters the words of God;
   if one does some service, let him do it as with strength which God
   supplies, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus
   Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

   ^12Dear friends, do not be surprised that a test of fire is being
   applied to you, as though a strange thing were happening to you,

   ^13but be glad that you are in a measure sharing the sufferings of the
   Christ, so that when his glory is revealed you may be triumphantly
   happy.

   ^14If you are being abused for the sake of Christ, you are blessed,
   because the glorious Spirit of God is resting upon you.

   ^15For no one of you must suffer as a murderer or thief or criminal or
   revolutionist,

   ^16but if a man suffers for being a Christian, he must not be ashamed
   of it, but must do honor to God through that name.

   ^17For the time has come for the judgment to begin with the household
   of God, and if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who
   refuse God's good news?

   ^18If it is hard for the upright man to be saved, what will become of
   the godless and sinful?

   ^19Therefore, those who suffer by the will of God must intrust their
   souls to a Creator who is faithful, and continue to do what is right.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1I appeal therefore to those who are elders among you; I am their
   brother-elder and a witness to what the Christ suffered, and I am to
   share in the glory that is to be revealed--

   ^2be shepherds of the flock of God that is among you, not as though it
   were forced upon you but of your own free will, and not from base love
   of gain but freely,

   ^3and not as tyrannizing over those in your charge but proving models
   for the flock;

   ^4and when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the glorious
   wreath that will never fade.

   ^5You younger men must show deference to the elders. And you must all
   clothe yourselves in humility toward one another, for God opposes the
   proud, but shows mercy to the humble.

   ^6Submit humbly, therefore, to God's mighty hand, so that he may in due
   time raise you up.

   ^7Throw all your anxiety upon him, for he cares for you.

   ^8Be calm and watchful. Your opponent the devil is prowling about like
   a roaring lion, wanting to devour you.

   ^9Resist him and be strong in the faith, for you know that your
   brotherhood all over the world is having the same experience of
   suffering.

   ^10And God, the giver of all mercy, who through your union with Christ
   has called you to his eternal glory, after you have suffered a little
   while will himself make you perfect, steadfast, and strong.

   ^11His be the dominion forever. Amen.

   ^12By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I think him, I have written
   you this short letter to encourage you and bear my testimony that this
   is what the true mercy of God means. Stand fast in it.

   ^13Your sister-church in Babylon, chosen like you, and Mark my son wish
   to be remembered to you.

   ^14Greet one another with a kiss of love.

   Peace to all of you that are in union with Christ.

The Second Letter of Peter
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who
   through the uprightness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have been
   given a faith as privileged as ours;

   ^2God bless you and give you perfect peace through the knowledge of God
   and of Jesus our Lord.

   ^3For his divine power has given us every requisite for life and piety,
   through our coming to know him who through his glory and excellence
   called us to him.

   ^4Thus he has given us his precious and splendid promises so that
   through them you may escape the corrupting influences that exist in the
   world through passion, and come to share in the divine nature.

   ^5For this very reason make every effort to supplement your faith with
   goodness, goodness with knowledge,

   ^6knowledge with self-control, self-control with steadfastness,
   steadfastness with piety,

   ^7piety with a spirit of brotherhood, and the spirit of brotherhood
   with love.

   ^8For if you have these qualities in their fulness, they will make you
   neither idle nor unproductive when it comes to the understanding of our
   Lord Jesus Christ.

   ^9For whoever lacks these qualities is blind or near-sighted, and has
   forgotten that he has been cleansed from his former sins.

   ^10Therefore, brothers, make all the greater efforts to make God's call
   and choice of you certain. For if you have these qualities, you will
   never stumble,

   ^11for then you will be triumphantly admitted to the eternal kingdom of
   our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

   ^12Therefore I will always remind you of this, although you know it and
   are firmly grounded in the truth that you have.

   ^13Yet I think it right, as long as I live in my present tent, to
   arouse you by a reminder,

   ^14for I know that I must soon put it away, as our Lord Jesus Christ
   has shown me.

   ^15I will also take care that after I am gone you will be able at any
   time to call these things to mind.

   ^16For they were no fictitious stories that we followed when we
   informed you of the power of our Lord Jesus Christ and of his coming,
   but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.

   ^17For when he was so honored and glorified by God the Father and from
   the supreme glory there were borne to him such words as these: "This is
   my Son, my Beloved! He is my Chosen!"--

   ^18we heard these words borne from heaven when we were with him on that
   sacred mountain.

   ^19So we have the message of the prophets more fully guaranteed. Please
   pay attention to that message as to a lamp shining in a dark place,
   until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

   ^20You must understand this in the first place, that no prophecy in
   Scripture can be understood through one's own powers,

   ^21for no prophecy ever originated in the human will, but under the
   influence of the holy Spirit men spoke for God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1There were false prophets too among the people, just as there will be
   false teachers among you, who will introduce destructive sects and deny
   the Master who has bought them, thus bringing on themselves swift
   destruction.

   ^2Many people will follow their immoral ways, and they will cause the
   true way to be maligned.

   ^3In their greed they will exploit you with pretended arguments. From
   of old their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has
   not slumbered.

   ^4For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but plunged them
   into Tartarus, and committed them to dark dungeons to await their doom,

   ^5and if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a
   preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought the flood
   upon the godless world;

   ^6and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and overwhelmed
   them with ashes, as a warning to ungodly men of what was to come,

   ^7and saved the upright Lot who was so distressed by the immoral
   conduct of unprincipled men--

   ^8for as long as that upright man lived among them, day after day his
   upright soul was tormented by what he saw and heard of their lawless
   actions--

   ^9then the Lord knows how to rescue God-fearing people from trial and
   to punish wrongdoers while they are being kept for the Day of Judgment,

   ^10especially those who yield to their physical nature and indulge in
   passions that defile them, and despise authority. Rash, headstrong men!
   They stand in no awe of majesty, but deride beings

   ^11against whom even angels far superior to these beings in strength
   and power bring no abusive charge before the Lord.

   ^12These men, like unreasoning animals, mere creatures of instinct
   created to be caught and killed, abuse what they do not understand and
   will be destroyed like animals,

   ^13suffering wrong as the reward for their wrongdoing. They find
   pleasure in the indulgence of the moment; they are a stain and a
   disgrace, and they revel in their deceit while they join in your
   religious meals.

   ^14They have eyes for nobody but adulterous women--eyes insatiable in
   sin. They lure unsteadfast souls. Their hearts are trained in greed.
   They are accursed!

   ^15They have left the straight path and gone astray. They have followed
   the path of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on dishonest
   gain,

   ^16but he was rebuked for his offense; a dumb animal spoke with a human
   voice and checked the prophet's madness.

   ^17Such men are dried-up springs, clouds driven before the storm, and
   they are doomed to utter darkness.

   ^18They utter arrogant nonsense and use physical cravings to lure into
   immorality men who are just escaping from among those who live in
   error;

   ^19promising them freedom when they are themselves slaves of
   destruction; for a man is the slave of whatever overcomes him.

   ^20For if after men have escaped the corrupting influences of the world
   through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they again
   become entangled in them and are overcome by them, their final
   condition is worse than their former one.

   ^21For it would have been better for them never to have known the way
   of uprightness than after knowing it to have turned their backs upon
   the sacred command with which they had been intrusted.

   ^22What has happened to them shows the truth of the proverb, "A dog
   returns to what he has vomited up, and a sow that has washed goes back
   to wallow in the mire."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1This is the second letter, dear friends, that I have now written to
   you, in the effort to arouse your unsullied minds

   ^2to remember the things foretold by the holy prophets, and the command
   of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.

   ^3First of all, you must understand this, that in the last days mockers
   will come with their mockeries, going where their passions lead

   ^4and saying, "Where is his promised coming? For ever since our
   forefathers fell asleep everything has remained as it was from the
   beginning of creation!"

   ^5For they wilfully ignore the fact that long ago there existed heavens
   and an earth which had been formed at God's command out of water and by
   water,

   ^6by which also that world was destroyed, through being flooded with
   water.

   ^7But by the same command the present heavens and earth are stored up
   for fire, and are kept for the day when godless men are to be judged
   and destroyed.

   ^8But do not overlook this one fact, dear friends, that with the Lord
   one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day.

   ^9The Lord is not slow about his promise, in the sense that some men
   think; he is really showing his patience with you, because he does not
   want any to perish, but wishes all men to be brought to repentance.

   ^10The Day of the Lord will come like a thief; on it the heavens will
   pass away with a roar, the heavenly bodies will burn up and be
   destroyed, and the earth and all its works will melt away.

   ^11If all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what holy and
   pious lives you ought to lead,

   ^12while you await and hasten the coming of the Day of God, which will
   cause the heavens to burn up and dissolve and the heavenly bodies to
   blaze and melt.

   ^13In fulfilment of his promise we expect new heavens and a new earth,
   where uprightness will prevail.

   ^14Therefore, dear friends, while waiting for this, make every effort
   to be found by him unstained, irreproachable, and at peace.

   ^15Look upon our Lord's patience as salvation, just as our dear brother
   Paul, with the wisdom that God gave him, wrote you to do,

   ^16speaking of it as he does in all his letters. There are some things
   in them hard to understand, which ignorant, unsteadfast people twist to
   their own ruin, just as they do the rest of the Scriptures.

   ^17So you, dear friends, now that you are forewarned, must be on your
   guard against being led away by the errors of unprincipled men and
   losing your present firmness.

   ^18You must grow in the blessing and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
   Jesus Christ. Glory to him now and forever.

The First Letter of John
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1It is what existed from the beginning, that we announce; what we have
   heard, what we have seen with our own eyes, what we have beheld, and
   touched with our hands; it is the very message of life--

   ^2for life has been revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it and
   announce to you that eternal life that was with the Father and has been
   revealed to us--

   ^3it is what we have seen and heard that we announce to you also, so
   that you may share our fellowship, for our fellowship is with the
   Father and with his Son Jesus Christ,

   ^4and we write this to you to make your happiness complete.

   ^5This is the message that we heard from him and announce to you: God
   is light; there is no darkness in him at all.

   ^6If we say, "We have fellowship with him," and yet live in darkness,
   we are lying and not living the truth.

   ^7But if we live in the light, just as he is in the light, we have
   fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us
   from every sin.

   ^8If we say, "We are without any sin," we are deceiving ourselves, and
   there is no truth in our hearts.

   ^9If we acknowledge our sins, he is upright and can be depended on to
   forgive our sins and cleanse us from everything wrong.

   ^10If we say, "We have not sinned," we are making him a liar, and his
   message is not in our hearts.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1My dear children, I am writing you this so that you may not sin; yet
   if anyone does sin, we have in Jesus Christ one who is upright and will
   intercede for us with the Father.

   ^2He is himself an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for
   ours but also for the whole world.

   ^3This is how we can be sure that we know him--by obeying his commands.

   ^4Whoever says, "I know him," but does not obey his commands, is a
   liar, and there is no truth in his heart;

   ^5but whoever obeys his message really has the love of God in
   perfection in his heart. This is the way we can be sure that we are in
   union with him;

   ^6whoever says, "I am always in union with him" must live just as he
   lived.

   ^7Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing you, but an old
   one that you have had from the beginning. That old command is the same
   as the message you have heard.

   ^8Yet it is a new command that I am writing you; it is newly realized
   in him and in yourselves, for the darkness is passing and the true
   light is already shining.

   ^9Whoever says, "I am in the light," and yet hates his brother, is
   still in darkness.

   ^10Whoever loves his brother is always in the light and puts no
   hindrance in anyone's way.

   ^11But whoever hates his brother is in darkness, and is living in
   darkness, and he does not know where he is going, for the darkness has
   blinded his eyes.

   ^12I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been
   forgiven for his sake.

   ^13I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who has existed
   from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have
   been victorious over the evil one. I write to you, children, because
   you know the Father.

   ^14I write to you, fathers, because you know him who has existed from
   the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and
   God's message is always in your hearts, and you have been victorious
   over the evil one.

   ^15Do not love the world or what is in the world. If anyone loves the
   world, there is no love for the Father in his heart,

   ^16for all that there is in the world, the things that our physical
   nature and our eyes crave, and the proud display of life--these do not
   come from the Father, but from the world;

   ^17and the world with its cravings is passing away, but whoever does
   God's will will endure forever.

   ^18Children, it is the last hour. You have heard that Antichrist is
   coming, and many Antichrists have indeed appeared. So we may be sure
   that it is the last hour.

   ^19They have gone out from our number, but they did not really belong
   to us. For if they had, they would have stayed with us. It was to make
   it clear that none of them really belonged to us that they withdrew.

   ^20But you have been anointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth;

   ^21I do not write to you because you do not know it, but because you do
   know it, and because no lie can come from the truth.

   ^22Who is such a liar as the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ?
   He is the real Antichrist--the man who disowns the Father and the Son.

   ^23No one who disowns the Son can have the Father. Whoever acknowledges
   the Son has the Father too.

   ^24Keep what you have heard from the beginning in your hearts; then you
   will always be in union with the Son and the Father.

   ^25And what he himself has promised us is eternal life.

   ^26I write you this with reference to those who are trying to mislead
   you.

   ^27You still retain in your hearts the anointing with the Spirit that
   you received from him, and you do not need to have anyone teach you.
   But just as that anointing of his teaches you about everything, and as
   it is true and no falsehood, keep in union with him just as it has
   taught you to do.

   ^28Now, dear children, keep in union with him, so that if he appears,
   we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame when he comes.

   ^29If you know that he is upright, you may be sure that everyone who
   acts uprightly is his child.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1Think what love the Father has had for us, in letting us be called
   God's children, for that is what we are. This is why the world does not
   know what we are--because it has never come to know him.

   ^2Dear friends, we are God's children now; it has not yet been
   disclosed what we are to be. We know that if he appears, we shall be
   like him, for we shall see him as he is.

   ^3And everyone who possesses this hope in him tries to make himself as
   pure as he is.

   ^4Whoever commits sin disobeys law; sin is disobedience to law.

   ^5You know that he appeared to take our sins away, and that there is no
   sin in him.

   ^6No one who keeps in union with him sins. Anyone who sins has never
   seen him or come to know him.

   ^7Dear children, let no one mislead you; whoever acts uprightly is
   upright, just as he is upright.

   ^8Whoever commits sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has sinned
   from the beginning. This is why the Son of God appeared--to undo the
   devil's work.

   ^9No one who is a child of God commits sin, for God's nature remains in
   his heart, and he cannot sin, because he is a child of God.

   ^10This is how the children of God and those of the devil can be
   distinguished: No one who does not act uprightly or who does not love
   his brother is a child of God.

   ^11For the message you have heard from the beginning is this: We must
   love one another.

   ^12We must not be like Cain who was a child of the evil one, and
   butchered his brother. And why did he butcher him? Because his own
   actions were wicked and his brother's upright.

   ^13You must not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you!

   ^14We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love
   our brothers. Anyone who does not love is still in death.

   ^15Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no
   murderer can have eternal life remain in his heart.

   ^16We know what love means from the fact that he laid down his life for
   us; so we also ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.

   ^17But if someone who is rich sees his brother in need and closes his
   heart against him, how can he have any love for God in his heart?

   ^18Dear children, let us love not with words or lips only but in
   reality and truth.

   ^19From that we can be sure that we are on the side of the truth, and
   satisfy our consciences in God's sight,

   ^20if they condemn us for anything, for God is greater than our
   consciences, and he knows all.

   ^21Dear friends, if our consciences do not condemn us, we approach God
   with confidence,

   ^22and we obtain from him whatever we ask for, because we are obeying
   his commands and doing the things that please him.

   ^23His command is this--that we are to believe in his Son Jesus Christ,
   and love one another, as he has commanded us to do.

   ^24All who obey his commands keep in union with him, and he does with
   them; and this is how we know that he keeps in union with us--by the
   Spirit which he has given us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1Dear friends, do not believe every inspired utterance, but test the
   utterances to see whether they come from God, for many false prophets
   have come out into the world.

   ^2You can tell the Spirit of God in this way: all inspiration that
   acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in human form comes from God,

   ^3and any inspired utterance that does not acknowledge Jesus does not
   come from God; it is the inspiration of the Antichrist. You have heard
   that it was coming, and here it is already in the world.

   ^4You are children of God, dear children, and you have been victorious
   over these men, for he who is in our hearts is greater than he who is
   in the world.

   ^5They are children of the world; that is why they speak as the world
   directs, and the world listens to them.

   ^6We are God's children. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is
   not a child of God will not listen to us. In this way we can tell what
   is inspired by truth from what is inspired by error.

   ^7Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God, and
   everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.

   ^8Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.

   ^9God's love for us has been revealed in this way--that God has sent
   his only Son into the world, to let us have life through him.

   ^10The love consists not in our having loved God, but in his loving us
   and sending his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

   ^11Dear friends, if God has loved us so, we ought to love one another.

   ^12No one has ever seen God; yet if we love one another, God keeps in
   union with us and love for him attains perfection in our hearts.

   ^13This is the way we know that we keep in union with him and he does
   with us--because he has given us some of his Spirit.

   ^14We have seen and can testify that the Father has sent the Son to be
   Savior of the world.

   ^15If anyone acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God
   keeps in union with him and he with God.

   ^16So we know and believe in the love God has for us.

   God is love, and whoever continues to love keeps in union with God, and
   God with him.

   ^17Love attains perfection in us, when we have perfect confidence about
   the Day of Judgment, because here in this world we are living as he
   lives.

   ^18There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear. For fear
   suggests punishment and no one who feels fear has attained perfect
   love.

   ^19We love because he loved us first.

   ^20If anyone says, "I love God," and yet hates his brother, he is a
   liar; for whoever does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot
   love God whom he has not seen.

   ^21This is the command that we get from him, that whoever loves God
   must love his brother also.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and
   everyone who loves the Father loves those who are his children.

   ^2This is how we can be sure that we love the children of God: it is by
   loving God and obeying his commands.

   ^3For loving God means obeying his commands, and his commands are not
   burdensome,

   ^4for every child of God is victorious over the world. Our faith is the
   victory that has triumphed over the world.

   ^5For who is there that is victorious over the world except the man who
   believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

   ^6It was he, Jesus Christ himself, who came in water and in blood; not
   in water only, but in water and in blood. The Spirit also testifies to
   this, for the Spirit is truth.

   ^7For there are three that testify to it,

   ^8the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the three are at one.

   ^9If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is stronger
   still; for the value of God's testimony lies in this, that he has
   testified to his Son.

   ^10Whoever believes in the Son of God possesses that testimony in his
   heart. Anyone who will not believe God has made him a liar, for he has
   refused to believe the testimony that God has borne to his Son.

   ^11And that testimony is that God has given us eternal life, and that
   this life is found in his Son.

   ^12Whoever has the Son has life; whoever has not the Son has not life.

   ^13I have written this so that you who believe in the Son of God may
   know that you have eternal life.

   ^14And we have confidence in him, that if we ask him for anything that
   is in accordance with his will, he will listen to us.

   ^15And if we know that he listens to whatever we ask him for, we know
   that the requests we have made of him are granted.

   ^16If anyone sees his brother committing any sin except a deadly one,
   he will ask and obtain life for him--provided the sin is not a deadly
   one. There is such a thing as deadly sin; I do not say that a man
   should pray about that.

   ^17Any wrongdoing is sin, but there are sins that are not deadly.

   ^18We know that no child of God commits sin, but the fact that he is
   God's child protects him, and the evil one cannot touch him.

   ^19We know that we are children of God, while the whole world is under
   the power of the evil one.

   ^20And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us power to
   recognize him who is true; and we are in union with him who is true,
   through his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.

   ^21Dear children, keep away from idols.

The Second Letter of John

  Chapter 1

   ^1The Elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I truly love--and
   not only I but all who know the truth--

   ^2because of the truth that stays in our hearts and will be with us
   forever;

   ^3blessing, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father and Jesus
   Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love.

   ^4It makes me exceedingly happy to find that some of your children are
   guided by truth, just as we have been commanded to be by the Father.

   ^5And now I beg you, my lady--not as though I were writing you any new
   command, but one which we have had from the beginning--let us love one
   another.

   ^6Love means this, that we be guided by his commands. The command, as
   you have heard from the beginning, is to be guided by love.

   ^7For many impostors have gone out into the world--men who do not
   acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in human form. That is the mark
   of the impostor and the Antichrist.

   ^8Look out for yourselves, take care not to lose what we have worked
   for, but make sure that you are paid for it in full.

   ^9Anyone who goes too far and does not keep to the teaching of Christ
   has not God. It is the man who holds to the teaching who has both the
   Father and the Son.

   ^10If anyone comes to you without bringing this teaching, do not let
   him come into the house or bid him good morning.

   ^11For anyone who bids him good morning shares in his wicked work.

   ^12Though I have a great deal to write to you, I would rather not write
   it with paper and ink, but I hope to come to see you, and talk with you
   face to face, so that your happiness may be complete.

   ^13The children of your chosen sister wish to be remembered to you.

The Third Letter of John
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1The Elder to my dear friend Gaius, whom I truly love.

   ^2Dear friend, it is my prayer that everything is going well with you
   and that you are well; I know it is well with your soul.

   ^3For it makes me exceedingly happy to have some brothers come and
   testify to the truth of your life, for you are guided by truth.

   ^4I know of no greater blessing than hearing that my children are being
   guided by the truth.

   ^5Dear friend, it is loyal of you to do anything you can for the
   brothers, especially as they are strangers;

   ^6they have testified before the church to your love. Please see them
   off on their journey in a way appropriate to God's service.

   ^7For they have started out for the sake of the cause, and they are
   accepting nothing from the heathen.

   ^8So we ought to support such men, to show that we are ready to
   co-operate with the truth.

   ^9I have written briefly to the church, but Diotrephes who likes to be
   their leader will not accept what I say.

   ^10So if I come, I will bring up the things that he is doing, and how
   he is maliciously accusing me. Not content with that, he refuses to
   welcome the brothers himself, and he is interfering with those who want
   to do so, and has them put out of the church.

   ^11Dear friend, do not follow bad examples, but good ones. The man who
   does right is a child of God; the man who does wrong has never seen
   God.

   ^12Everybody testifies to Demetrius; the truth itself does; I testify
   to him too, and you know that my testimony to him is true.

   ^13I have a great deal to write to you, but I do not want to write it
   with pen and ink;

   ^14I hope to see you very soon and we will talk face to face. Goodbye.
   Our friends wish to be remembered to you. Remember me to our friends,
   every one.

The Letter of Jude
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, and the brother of James, to those who
   have been called, who are dear to God the Father and have been kept
   through union with Jesus Christ;

   ^2may mercy, peace, and love be granted you in abundance.

   ^3Dear friends, I was just on the point of writing to you about our
   common salvation, when it became necessary for me to write and appeal
   to you to come to the defense of the faith that has once for all been
   intrusted to God's people.

   ^4For some people have sneaked in among us--their doom was foretold
   long ago--godless persons, who turn the mercy of our God into an excuse
   for immorality, and disown our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

   ^5Now I want to remind you, though you know it all already, that he who
   brought the people safely out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed
   the ones who did not believe,

   ^6and the angels who neglected their responsibilities and abandoned
   their homes he has put in everlasting chains to be kept in darkness for
   the judgment of the great Day,

   ^7just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring towns which like them
   indulged in immorality and unnatural vice stand as a warning, in
   undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.

   ^8In that same way these dreamers defile the body, make light of
   authority, and deride majesty.

   ^9The archangel Michael himself, when he had the dispute with the devil
   about Moses' body, did not venture to condemn him for blasphemy; he
   only said, "May the Lord rebuke you!"

   ^10But these people deride anything they do not understand, and the
   things they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, they use for
   their own destruction.

   ^11Alas for them, for they follow Cain's path, they plunge into
   Balaam's error for gain, and they perish in rebelliousness like
   Korah's.

   ^12They are stains on your religious meals, where they carouse
   together, boldly attending to no one but themselves; rainless clouds
   driven before the wind; leafless trees without fruit, doubly dead, and
   uprooted;

   ^13wild sea waves foaming up their own shame; wandering stars doomed
   forever to utter darkness.

   ^14Of them also Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied,
   when he said, "See! The Lord comes with his holy myriads

   ^15to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the godless of all
   the godless deeds they have done, and of all the harsh things that
   godless sinners have said against him."

   ^16These men are grumblers, dissatisfied with life. They go where their
   passions lead, their talk is arrogant and they cultivate people in the
   hope of gain.

   ^17But you, dear friends, must remember what was foretold by the
   apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,

   ^18for they said to you, "In the last times there will be mockers who
   will go where their own godless passions lead."

   ^19These are the men who create division; they are animal and devoid of
   the Spirit.

   ^20But you, dear friends, must build yourselves up on the foundation of
   your most holy faith and pray in the holy Spirit,

   ^21and keep in the love of God, and wait for the mercy of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, to bring you to eternal life.

   ^22Those whom you pity in their uncertainty,

   ^23save, snatching them out of the fire, and look on others with pity
   mixed with fear, loathing even the clothes their animal nature has
   stained.

   ^24Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to make you
   stand in his presence irreproachable and triumphant--

   ^25to the one God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority
   through Jesus Christ our Lord now and forever and ever. Amen.

The Revelation of John
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 1

   ^1A revelation made by Jesus Christ which God gave him to disclose to
   his slaves of what must very soon happen. He sent and communicated it
   by his angel to his slave John,

   ^2who testifies to what he saw--to the message of God and the testimony
   of Jesus Christ.

   ^3Blessed be the man who reads this prophecy and those who hear it read
   and heed what is written in it, for the time is near.

   ^4John to the seven churches in Asia, blessing and peace to you from
   him who is and was and is coming, and from the seven spirits before his
   throne,

   ^5and from Jesus Christ the trustworthy witness, the firstborn of the
   dead, and the sovereign of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us
   and has released us from our sins by his blood

   ^6he has made us a kingdom of priests for his God and Father--to him be
   glory and power forever. Amen.

   ^7See! He is coming on the clouds, and every eye will see him, even the
   men who pierced him, and all the tribes of the earth will lament over
   him. So it is to be, Amen.

   ^8"I am the Alpha and the Omega." says the Lord God, who is and was and
   is coming, the Almighty.

   ^9I, John, your brother and companion in the distress, the kingdom, and
   the endurance that Jesus brings, found myself on the island called
   Patmos, for uttering God's message and testifying to Jesus.

   ^10On the Lord's day I fell into a trance, and I heard a loud voice
   like a trumpet behind me

   ^11say,

   "Write what you see in a roll and send it to the seven churches--to
   Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and
   Laodicea."

   ^12I turned to see whose voice it was that was speaking to me, and when
   I turned I saw seven gold lampstands,

   ^13and among the lampstands a being like a man, wearing a long robe,
   with a gold belt around his breast.

   ^14His head and hair were as white as white wool, as white as snow; his
   eyes blazed like fire;

   ^15his feet were like bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was
   like the noise of mighty waters.

   ^16In his right hand he held seven stars; from his mouth came a sharp
   double-edged sword, and his face shone like the sun at noonday.

   ^17When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. But he laid his
   right hand upon me, and said,

   "Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last,

   ^18the living one. I was dead, yet here I am alive forever and ever. I
   hold the keys of death and the underworld.

   ^19So write what you have seen, what is now and what is to happen
   hereafter.

   ^20The secret meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand,
   and of the seven gold lampstands is this: The seven stars are the
   guardian angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the
   seven churches.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 2

   ^1"To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:

   " He who holds the seven stars in his right hand and goes about among
   the seven gold lampstands speaks thus:

   ^2I know what you have done; your hard work and your endurance. I know
   that you cannot tolerate wicked men, and that you have tested those who
   claimed to be apostles when they were not, and have found them to be
   impostors.

   ^3You show endurance; you have undergone much for my sake, and you have
   not grown weary.

   ^4But I hold it against you that you do not love as you did at first.

   ^5So remember how far you have fallen, and repent and do as you did at
   first, or else I will come to you and take your lampstand from its
   place, if you do not repent.

   ^6But it is in your favor that you hate the practices of the
   Nicolaitans, as I do.

   ^7Let everyone who can hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
   churches. I will permit him who is victorious to eat the fruit of the
   tree of life that stands in the Paradise of God.'

   ^8"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:

   " The first and the last, who died and came to life again, speaks thus:

   ^9I know of your distress and poverty--though you are rich!--I know how
   you are slandered by those who claim to be Jews when they are not so,
   but only a synagogue of Satan!

   ^10Do not be afraid of what you are going to suffer. See! The devil is
   going to put some of you into prison to be tested there, and for ten
   days to endure persecution. Prove faithful even unto death and I will
   give you the crown of life.

   ^11Let everyone who can hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
   churches. He who is victorious will not be hurt by the second death.'

   ^12"To the angel of the church in Pergamum write:

   " He who wields the sharp, double-edged sword speaks thus:

   ^13I know where you live; where Satan has his throne! Yet you cling to
   my name and did not renounce your faith in me even in the days when my
   faithful Antipas, my witness, was put to death among you--where Satan
   lives.

   ^14Yet I hold it somewhat against you that you have among you some
   adherents of the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entrap the
   children of Israel into eating meat that had been sacrificed to idols,
   and into immoral practices.

   ^15So you also have among you some who hold the teaching of the
   Nicolaitans.

   ^16So repent, or else I will come to you quickly and make war upon them
   with the sword that is in my mouth.

   ^17Let everyone who can hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
   churches. I will give him who is victorious some of the hidden manna,
   and I will give him a white pebble with a new name written on it which
   no one knows except the man who receives it.'

   ^18"To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:

   " The Son of God, whose eyes blaze like fire, and whose feet are like
   bronze, speaks thus:

   ^19I know the things you do, your love and faithfulness and helpfulness
   and endurance, and I know that you are now doing more than you did at
   first.

   ^20But I hold it against you that you tolerate that Jezebel of a woman
   who claims to be inspired and who is misleading my slaves and teaching
   them to practice immorality and to eat meat that has been sacrificed to
   idols.

   ^21I have given her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her
   immorality.

   ^22See! I am going to lay her on a sick bed, and to bring great
   distress upon those who share her immorality, unless they repent of her
   practices,

   ^23and I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know
   that I am he who searches men's hearts and minds, and I will repay each
   of you for what you have done.

   ^24But to the rest of you at Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching
   and have not learned the "deep things" of Satan, as they call them--to
   you I say, I have no fresh burden to lay on you,

   ^25but keep hold of what you have, until I come.

   ^26To him who is victorious and continues to the end to do the things
   that please me, I will give authority over the heathen--

   ^27just such authority as I received from my Father; he will shepherd
   them with an iron staff and shatter them like earthen jars!--

   ^28and I will give him the morning star.

   ^29Let everyone who can hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
   churches.'
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 3

   ^1"To the angel of the church in Sardis write:

   " He who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars speaks
   thus: I know what you are doing; you are supposed to be alive, but you
   are dead.

   ^2Wake up, and strengthen what is left, although it is already on the
   point of death, for I have found nothing you have done complete in the
   sight of my God.

   ^3So remember what you received and heard, and obey it, and repent. If
   you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at
   what hour I am coming upon you.

   ^4Yet you have a few at Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They
   will walk with me clad in white, for they deserve to.

   ^5He who is victorious will be clothed thus, in white clothing, and I
   will not erase his name from the book of life, but I will acknowledge
   him as mine in the presence of my Father and his angels.

   ^6Let everyone who can hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
   churches.'

   ^7"To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:

   " He who is holy and true, who carries the key of David, who opens and
   no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open, speaks thus:

   ^8I know what you are doing. See! I have put before you an open door
   that no one can close. I know that you have little strength, but you
   have obeyed my message and you have not disowned my name.

   ^9I will make some who belong to that synagogue of Satan and claim to
   be Jews when they are not so, but are lying--I will make them come and
   bow down at your feet, and learn that I loved you.

   ^10Because you have kept in mind the message of what I endured, I also
   will keep you safe in the time of testing that is going to come upon
   the whole world, to test the inhabitants of the earth.

   ^11I am coming soon. Keep hold of what you have, so that no one may
   deprive you of your crown.

   ^12I will make him who is victorious a pillar in the temple of my God;
   he shall never go out of it again. I will write on him the name of my
   God and the name of the city of my God--the new Jerusalem, which is to
   come down out of heaven from my God--and my new name.

   ^13Let everyone who can hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
   churches.'

   ^14"To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:

   " The Amen, the true and faithful witness, the origin of God's
   creation, speaks thus:

   ^15I know what you are doing, and that you are neither cold nor hot. I
   wish you were either cold or hot!

   ^16As it is, since you are tepid and neither cold nor hot, I am going
   to spit you out of my mouth!

   ^17Because you say, "I am rich, I have become wealthy, I need nothing,"
   and you do not know that it is you that are wretched, pitiable, poor,
   blind, and naked,

   ^18I advise you to buy of me gold that has been tested with fire, so
   that you may be rich, and white clothes to put on, to keep your
   shameful nakedness from being seen, and salve to put on your eyes, to
   make you see.

   ^19I reprove and discipline all whom I love. So be earnest and repent.

   ^20Here I stand knocking at the door. If anyone listens to my voice and
   opens the door, I will be his guest and dine with him, and he with me.

   ^21I will permit him who is victorious to take his seat beside me on my
   throne, just as I have been victorious and taken my seat beside my
   Father on his throne.

   ^22Let everyone who can hear listen to what the Spirit says to the
   churches.' "
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 4

   ^1Afterward I had another vision: There was a door standing open in the
   heavens and the first voice like a trumpet that I had heard speak to
   me, said,

   "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place."

   ^2Immediately after this I found myself in a trance, and there stood a
   throne in heaven with a being seated on it.

   ^3The one who was seated on it looked like jasper and sardius, and
   around the throne was a halo of the color of an emerald.

   ^4Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, with twenty-four elders
   seated on them, clothed in white and with gold crowns on their heads.

   ^5Out from the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals
   of thunder. In front of the throne seven blazing lamps were burning;
   they are the seven spirits of God.

   ^6In front of the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, like
   crystal. Around the throne, in the middle of each side, were four
   animals covered with eyes in front and behind.

   ^7The first animal was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the
   third had a face like a man's, and the fourth was like an eagle flying.

   ^8The four animals have each of them six wings, and they are covered
   with eyes all over and underneath their wings. And day and night they
   never cease to say,

   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and is and is
   coming."

   ^9And whenever the animals offer glory, honor, and thanksgiving to him
   who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,

   ^10the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the
   throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and they throw down
   their crowns before the throne, and say,

   ^11"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory, honor, and
   power, for you created all things; by your will they existed and were
   created."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 5

   ^1Then I saw lying in the right hand of him who was seated on the
   throne a roll with writing on both sides, sealed with seven seals.

   ^2And I saw a mighty angel announcing in a loud voice,

   "Who is fit to open the roll and break its seals?"

   ^3But no one in heaven or on earth or underneath the earth could open
   the roll or look into it.

   ^4Then I cried bitterly because no one could be found fit to open the
   roll or look into it.

   ^5But one of the elders said to me,

   "Do not cry! See! The lion who is of the tribe of Judah, of the line of
   David, has been victorious so that he can open the roll and break its
   seals."

   ^6Then I saw standing in the center of the throne and of the four
   animals and of the elders a Lamb which seemed to have been slaughtered.
   He had seven horns and seven eyes; these are the seven spirits of God,
   which are sent on errands to all parts of the earth.

   ^7He came and took the roll from the right hand of him who was seated
   on the throne.

   ^8When he took the roll, the four animals and the twenty-four elders
   fell down before the Lamb, each with a harp and gold bowls full of
   incense, that is, of the prayers of God's people.

   ^9Then they sang a new song:

   "You deserve to take the roll and open its seals, for you have been
   slaughtered, and with your blood have bought for God men from every
   tribe, tongue, people, and nation,

   ^10and have made them a kingdom of priests for our God, and they are to
   reign over the earth."

   ^11Then in my vision I heard the voices of many angels surrounding the
   throne, the animals, and the elders, numbering myriads of myriads and
   thousands of thousands,

   ^12saying in a loud voice,

   "The Lamb that was slaughtered deserves to receive power, wealth,
   wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing."

   ^13Then I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, underneath the
   earth, and on the sea, and all that they contain, say,

   "Blessing, honor, glory, and power to him who is seated on the throne
   and to the Lamb forever and ever!"

   ^14The four animals said,

   "Amen!"

   And the elders fell down and worshiped.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 6

   ^1In my vision, when the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals, I
   heard the first of the four animals say with a voice like thunder,

   "Come!"

   ^2Then I saw a white horse, and its rider carried a bow. He was given a
   crown, and he rode forth as a victor to conquer.

   ^3When he broke the second seal, I heard the second animal say,

   "Come!"

   ^4And another horse came forth, bright red, and its rider was given
   power to take peace away from the earth, and make men slaughter one
   another; he was given a great sword.

   ^5When he broke the third seal, I heard the third animal say,

   "Come!"

   And there I saw a black horse, and its rider had a pair of scales in
   his hand,

   ^6and I heard a voice which seemed to come from the midst of the four
   animals say,

   "Wheat at a dollar a quart, and barley three quarts for a dollar, but
   you must not injure the oil and wine!"

   ^7When he broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal
   say,

   "Come!"

   ^8And there I saw a horse the color of ashes, and its rider's name was
   Death, and Hades followed him. They were given power over one quarter
   of the earth, to kill the people with sword, famine, death, and the
   wild animals of the earth.

   ^9When he broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of
   those who have been slaughtered on account of God's message and for
   adhering to the testimony.

   ^10They cried out in a loud voice,

   "Holy and true Master, how long is it to be before you judge the
   inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?"

   ^11Then each of them was given a white robe and they were told to be
   quiet a little while longer, until the number of their fellow-slaves
   and their brothers, who were to be killed as they had been, should be
   complete.

   ^12When he broke the sixth seal I saw that there was a great
   earthquake. The sun turned black as sackcloth; the full moon became
   like blood;

   ^13the stars of the sky fell upon the earth just as a fig tree drops
   its unripe figs when it is shaken by a strong wind;

   ^14the sky was torn apart and rolled up like a roll; and every mountain
   and island was dislodged from its place.

   ^15The kings of the earth, the nobles, the officers, the rich, the
   strong--everybody, slave and free--hid themselves in the caves and
   among the rocks of the mountains.

   ^16And they said to the mountains and the rocks,

   "Fall on us, and conceal us from the sight of him who is seated on the
   throne, and from the anger of the Lamb,

   ^17for the great day of their anger has come, and who can escape?"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 7

   ^1After that I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the
   earth holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should
   blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.

   ^2Then I saw another angel ascend from the east with the seal of the
   living God, and he cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who had
   it in their power to harm the earth and the sea,

   ^3"Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we mark the
   slaves of our God on their foreheads."

   ^4I heard that the number of those that were marked with the seal was
   144,000. They were from every tribe of the children of Israel:

   ^512,000 from the tribe of Judah that were marked; 12,000 from the
   tribe of Reuben; 12,000 from the tribe of Gad;

   ^612,000 from the tribe of Asher; 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali;
   12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh;

   ^712,000 from the tribe of Symeon; 12,000 from the tribe of Levi;
   12,000 from the tribe of Issachar;

   ^812,000 from the tribe of Zebulon; 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph;
   12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin.

   ^9After that I saw a great crowd which no one could count from every
   nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and
   before the Lamb, wearing white robes, with palm branches in their
   hands,

   ^10and they cried in a loud voice,

   "Our deliverance is the work of our God who is seated on the throne,
   and of the Lamb!"

   ^11Then all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the
   four animals, and fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped
   God,

   ^12saying,

   "Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and
   strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen!"

   ^13Then one of the elders addressed me and said,

   "Who are these people dressed in white robes, and where do they come
   from?"

   ^14I said to him,

   "You know, my lord."

   He said to me,

   "They are the people who come through the great persecution, who have
   washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.

   ^15That is why they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and
   night in his temple, and he who is seated on the throne will shelter
   them.

   ^16They will never be hungry or thirsty again, and never again will the
   sun or any burning heat distress them,

   ^17for the Lamb who is in the center of the throne will be their
   shepherd, and will guide them to springs of living water, and God will
   wipe every tear from their eyes."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 8

   ^1When he broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about
   half an hour.

   ^2Then I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets
   were given to them.

   ^3Then another angel with a gold censer came and stood at the altar,
   and he was given a great quantity of incense so that he might mingle it
   with the prayers of all the saints on the altar of gold that stood
   before the throne.

   ^4So the smoke of the incense went up before God from the angel's hand
   for the prayers of his people.

   ^5Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the
   altar, and emptied it upon the earth, and there followed peals of
   thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.

   ^6Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.

   ^7The first blew his trumpet, and there was a storm of hail and fire
   mixed with blood, and it fell upon the earth, and one third of the
   earth was burned up, and one third of the trees were burned up, and all
   the green grass was burned up.

   ^8Then the second angel blew his trumpet, and what looked like a great
   mountain ablaze with fire was thrown into the sea, and one third of the
   sea turned into blood,

   ^9and one third of all the live creatures in the sea perished, and one
   third of the ships were destroyed.

   ^10Then the third angel blew his trumpet, and there fell from the sky a
   great star blazing like a torch, and it fell upon one third of the
   streams and the springs of water.

   ^11The star is called Apsinthus, that is, Wormwood. Then one third of
   the waters turned to wormwood, and numbers of people died of the
   waters, for they had turned bitter.

   ^12Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and one third of the sun was
   blasted, and one third of the moon and one third of the stars, so that
   one third of them were darkened, and there was no light for one third
   of the day and of the night.

   ^13Then in my vision I heard an eagle flying in midair say in a loud
   voice,

   "Alas! Alas! Alas for the inhabitants of the earth, because of the
   other blasts of the three angels who are going to blow their trumpets!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 9

   ^1Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had
   fallen on the earth from the sky. He was given the key to the pit of
   the abyss,

   ^2and he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke like the smoke of a
   great furnace poured up out of the pit, and the sun and the air were
   darkened by the smoke from the pit.

   ^3Out of the smoke locusts descended upon the earth, but with powers
   like those of earthly scorpions.

   ^4They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or
   tree, but only the men who did not have the mark of God's seal upon
   their foreheads.

   ^5They were not allowed to kill anyone, but only to torture them for
   five months, and the torture they inflicted was like that caused by a
   scorpion when it stings a man.

   ^6In those days men will seek death and never find it. They will want
   to die, but death will fly from them.

   ^7In appearance the locusts were like war-horses armed for battle; on
   their heads were what appeared to be crowns like gold; their faces were
   like human faces;

   ^8they had hair like a woman's; their teeth were like those of lions;

   ^9their breasts were like iron breast-plates, and the noise of their
   wings was like the noise of a great number of chariots and horses
   rushing into battle.

   ^10They had tails and stings like scorpions; it was in their tails that
   their power lay to harm men for five months.

   ^11They had over them as king the angel of the abyss, whose name in
   Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he is called Apollyon.

   ^12The first woe is past. See! Two woes are yet to come.

   ^13Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the
   corners of the altar of gold that was before God

   ^14say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet,

   "Release the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates."

   ^15Then the four angels who were held in readiness for that hour and
   day and month and year were let loose to kill one third of mankind.

   ^16The number of the hosts of horsemen was twice 10,000 times 10,000; I
   heard their number.

   ^17And this was how the horses and their riders looked in my vision:
   Their breast-plates were fire red, dark blue, and yellow. The horses'
   heads were like lions' heads, and fire, smoke, and sulphur poured from
   their mouths.

   ^18One third of mankind were killed by these three plagues--the fire,
   smoke, and sulphur that poured from their mouths.

   ^19For the power of the horses lay in their mouths and their tails;
   their tails were like snakes, and they had heads with which they hurt
   people.

   ^20Yet what was left of mankind, those who escaped being killed by
   these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands and give up
   worshiping demons and gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wooden idols,
   which cannot either see or hear or move,

   ^21and they did not repent of their murders, or their magic arts, or
   their immorality, or their thefts.

  Chapter 10

   ^1Then I saw another mighty angel descend from heaven. He was clothed
   in a cloud, and a rainbow encircled his head. His face was like the
   sun, his legs were like pillars of fire,

   ^2and he had a little scroll open in his hand. He set his right foot on
   the sea and his left foot on the land,

   ^3and he uttered a great shout like the roar of a lion; and when he
   shouted, the seven thunders raised their voices.

   ^4When the seven thunders had spoken I was going to write it down, but
   I heard a voice from heaven say,

   "Seal up what the seven thunders have said! Do not write it down!"

   ^5Then the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land,
   raised his right hand to heaven,

   ^6and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens
   and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea
   and all that is in it, that there should be no more delay,

   ^7but at the time when the seventh angel spoke, when he should blow his
   trumpet, then God's mysterious purpose, the good news of which he gave
   to his slaves the prophets, would be accomplished.

   ^8Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, and
   said,

   "Go and take the little scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel
   who is standing on the sea and on the land."

   ^9So I went up to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll.
   And he said to me,

   "Take it and eat it; it will be bitter in your stomach, but in your
   mouth it will taste as sweet as honey."

   ^10So I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it, and it
   did taste as sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, it made my
   stomach bitter.

   ^11Then they said to me,

   "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and
   kings!"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 11

   ^1Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told,

   "Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who
   worship there,

   ^2but leave out the court outside the temple; do not measure that, for
   it has been given up to the heathen, and for forty-two months they will
   trample on it.

   ^3And I will permit my two witnesses, clothed in sackcloth, to prophesy
   for 1,260 days."

   ^4They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before
   the Lord of the earth.

   ^5If anyone tries to hurt them fire comes out of their mouths and
   consumes their enemies; if anyone tries to hurt them, he will certainly
   be killed in that way.

   ^6They have the power to shut up the sky, so that no rain will fall
   during the days when they are prophesying, and they have power to turn
   the waters into blood and to smite the earth with any plague whenever
   they please.

   ^7When they finish their testimony, the animal that comes up out of the
   abyss will make war on them and conquer them and kill them,

   ^8and their bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is
   figuratively called Sodom and Egypt--where their Lord also was
   crucified.

   ^9For three days and a half, men of all peoples, tribes, languages, and
   nations will look at their bodies, and will not let them be buried.

   ^10The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate by
   sending presents to one another, for these two prophets were a torment
   to the inhabitants of the earth.

   ^11After three days and a half, the breath of life from God entered
   them, and they stood on their feet, and terror seized those who saw
   them.

   ^12And they heard a loud voice from heaven say to them,

   "Come up here."

   And they went up to heaven in a cloud, before the eyes of their
   enemies.

   ^13At that moment there was a great earthquake, and one tenth of the
   city was destroyed. Seven thousand people were killed in the
   earthquake, and the rest were filled with awe, and acknowledged the
   glory of the God of heaven.

   ^14The second woe is past. See! The third woe is soon to come.

   ^15Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and loud voices were heard
   in heaven, saying,

   "The sovereignty of the world has passed into the possession of our
   Lord and his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever."

   ^16Then the twenty-four elders who were seated on their thrones before
   God fell on their faces and worshiped God,

   ^17saying,

   "We give you thanks, Lord God Almighty, who are and were, because you
   have assumed your great power and begun to reign.

   ^18The heathen were enraged, but now your anger has come, and the time
   for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your slaves the prophets
   and your people high and low who revere your name, and for destroying
   the destroyers of the earth!"

   ^19Then the temple of God in heaven was thrown open, and the chest
   containing his agreement was seen inside the temple, and there were
   flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a
   great storm of hail.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 12

   ^1Then a great portent appeared in the sky--a woman clothed in the sun,
   with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.

   ^2She was soon to have a child, and she cried out with pain and agony
   in giving birth to it.

   ^3Another portent appeared in the sky--there was a great fire-red
   dragon with seven heads and ten horns, with seven diadems on his heads.

   ^4His tail swept away one third of the stars of heaven and flung them
   down upon the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was
   about to give birth to a child in order to devour her child as soon as
   it was born.

   ^5She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to shepherd all the
   heathen with a staff of iron; and her child was caught up to God, to
   his throne.

   ^6Then the woman fled into the desert, where there was a place prepared
   by God for her, where she was to be taken care of for 1,260 days.

   ^7Then war broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting with
   the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought

   ^8but they were defeated, and there was no place for them any longer in
   heaven.

   ^9So the great dragon, the ancient serpent who is called the devil and
   Satan, who deceives the whole world, was hurled down to the earth, and
   his angels were hurled down with him.

   ^10Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,

   "The deliverance and power and reign of our God, and the authority of
   his Christ have now come, for the accuser of our brothers, who kept
   bringing charges against them day and night before our God, has been
   hurled down.

   ^11They have conquered him because of the Lamb's blood, and the message
   to which they bore testimony, for they did not cling to life even in
   the face of death.

   ^12Therefore, rejoice, you heavens and you who live in them! But alas
   for the earth and the sea, for the devil has descended upon you in a
   great rage, for he knows that he has only a short time left."

   ^13When the dragon saw that he had been hurled down to the earth, he
   went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male child.

   ^14But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she
   might fly to her place in the desert, where she is to be taken care of
   for a time, times, and a half-time, on account of the serpent.

   ^15Then the serpent poured water from his mouth after the woman like a
   river, to sweep her away.

   ^16But the earth helped the woman, for the earth opened its mouth and
   swallowed the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth.

   ^17So the dragon was enraged at the woman, and he went off to make war
   on the rest of her children--those who obey God's commands and adhere
   to the testimony of Jesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 13

   ^1Then I stood on the sand of the seashore, and I saw an animal come up
   out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads, and with ten diadems on
   its horns, and blasphemous titles on its heads.

   ^2The animal I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear's, and
   its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave it his own power and
   his throne and great authority.

   ^3One of its heads seemed to have received a mortal wound, but its
   mortal wound had been healed. And the whole earth followed the animal
   in wonder,

   ^4and worshiped the dragon for having given the animal his authority,
   and they worshiped the animal, and said,

   "Who is there like the animal? Who can fight with it?"

   ^5It was allowed to utter great boasts and blasphemies, and to exert
   authority for forty-two months.

   ^6It opened its mouth in blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name
   and his dwelling-place, that is, those who live in heaven.

   ^7It was allowed to make war on God's people and to conquer them, and
   it was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.

   ^8All the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not from the
   foundation of the world been written in the slain Lamb's book of life,
   will worship it.

   ^9Let everyone who can hear listen.

   ^10Whoever is destined for captivity will go into captivity; whoever
   kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. On this fact rests
   the endurance and fidelity of God's people.

   ^11Then I saw another animal come up out of the land. It had two horns
   like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.

   ^12It exercises the full authority of the first animal on its behalf.
   It makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first animal, whose
   mortal wound had been healed.

   ^13It performs great wonders, even making fire come down from heaven to
   earth before men's eyes.

   ^14It leads the inhabitants of the earth astray by the wonders it is
   allowed to do on behalf of the animal, telling the inhabitants of the
   earth to erect a statue to the animal that bears the mark of the
   sword-thrust and yet lives.

   ^15It is also allowed to impart life to the animal's statue so that the
   animal's statue can speak, and to have all who do not worship the
   animal's statue killed.

   ^16And it makes everyone, high and low, rich and poor, freemen and
   slaves, have a mark stamped on their right hands or on their foreheads,

   ^17and permits no one to buy or sell anything unless he bears the mark,
   that is, the animal's name or the number corresponding to its name.

   ^18There is wisdom hidden here! Let everyone of intelligence calculate
   the animal's number, for it indicates a certain man; its number is 666.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 14

   ^1Then in my vision I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him
   144,000 people who had his name and his Father's name written on their
   foreheads.

   ^2And I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of great waters, and
   loud peals of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists
   playing on their harps.

   ^3They were singing a new song before the throne and the four animals
   and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who
   had been ransomed from the earth.

   ^4They are the men who have not been defiled by relations with women;
   they are celibates. It is they who follow the Lamb wherever he goes.
   They have been ransomed from among men as the first-fruits for God and
   the Lamb,

   ^5and they have never been known to utter a lie; they are
   irreproachable.

   ^6Then I saw another angel flying in midair, with eternal good news to
   announce to the inhabitants of the earth, to every nation, tribe,
   language, and people.

   ^7He cried in a loud voice,

   "Fear God and give him glory, for the hour for his judgment has come.
   Worship him who made heaven and earth and sea and the springs of
   water."

   ^8A second angel followed, saying,

   "She is fallen! Mighty Babylon is fallen, who made all the heathen
   drink the wine of the passion of her immorality!"

   ^9A third angel followed them, saying in a loud voice,

   "Whoever worships the animal and its statue and lets its mark be put on
   his forehead or on his hand

   ^10shall drink the wine of God's wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of
   his anger, and be tortured with fire and brimstone before the eyes of
   the holy angels and the Lamb.

   ^11The smoke of their torture will go up forever and ever, and they
   will have no rest night or day--these worshipers of the animal and its
   statue, and any who bear the mark of its name."

   ^12On this fact rests the endurance of God's people, who obey God's
   commands and cling to their faith in Jesus.

   ^13Then I heard a voice from heaven say,

   "Write: Blessed are the dead who from this time forth die as
   Christians!"

   "Yes!" answers the Spirit, "Let them rest from their toil, for what
   they have done will go with them!"

   ^14Then I saw a white cloud, and seated on it a being like a man, with
   a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.

   ^15And another angel came out of the temple and cried in a loud voice
   to him who was seated on the cloud,

   "Use your sickle and reap. The time has come to reap, for the earth's
   harvest is ripe."

   ^16So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth,
   and the earth was reaped.

   ^17Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a
   sharp sickle.

   ^18And another angel came forth from the altar, who presided over the
   fire, and he called in a loud voice to the one who had the sharp
   sickle,

   "Use your sharp sickle and gather the bunches of grapes from the
   earth's vine, for the grapes on it are ripe."

   ^19So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the fruit of
   the earth's vine, and flung them into the great winepress of God's
   wrath.

   ^20The grapes were trodden in the winepress outside the city, and blood
   poured out of the winepress in a stream so deep that for 200 miles it
   came up to the horses' bridles.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 15

   ^1Then I saw another great, marvelous portent in heaven. There were
   seven angels with seven plagues which are to be the last, for they
   complete the expression of God's wrath.

   ^2And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and
   standing upon the sea of glass those who had come off victorious from
   the animal and its statue and the number corresponding to its name.
   They had harps that God had given them,

   ^3and they were singing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the
   song of the Lamb:

   "Great and marvelous are your doings, Lord God Almighty! Upright and
   true are your ways, King of the Ages!

   ^4Who will not fear and give glory to your name, Lord? For you alone
   are holy. All the heathen will come and worship before you, for the
   justice of your sentences has now been shown."

   ^5Afterward I saw the temple, that is, the tent of the testimony,
   thrown open in heaven,

   ^6and the seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple.
   They were clothed in clean, glistening linen and had gold belts around
   their breasts.

   ^7Then one of the four animals gave the seven angels seven gold bowls
   full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever,

   ^8and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory and power of God,
   and no one could go into the temple until the seven plagues of the
   seven angels were over.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 16

   ^1Then I heard a loud voice from the temple say to the seven angels,

   "Go and empty the seven bowls of God's wrath upon the earth!"

   ^2So the first angel went and emptied his bowl upon the earth, and
   loathsome, painful sores attacked the men who bore the mark of the
   animal and worshiped its statue.

   ^3The second emptied his bowl upon the sea, and it turned into blood
   like a dead man's, and every live thing in the sea died.

   ^4The third emptied his bowl upon the rivers and the springs of water,
   and they turned into blood.

   ^5Then I heard the angel of the waters say,

   "You are just in pronouncing this sentence, you who are and were, the
   Holy One;

   ^6for they shed the blood of your people and prophets, and you have
   given them blood to drink, as they deserve."

   ^7And I heard the altar answer,

   "Yes, Lord God Almighty! Your sentences are true and just."

   ^8The fourth emptied his bowl upon the sun, and it was allowed to
   scorch mankind with its heat,

   ^9and they were dreadfully scorched, but they reviled the name of God
   who had control of these plagues, and would not repent and give him
   glory.

   ^10The fifth emptied his bowl upon the animal's throne, and its kingdom
   was plunged in darkness, and men gnawed their tongues in anguish

   ^11and reviled the God of heaven for their sufferings and sores, but
   they would not repent of what they had done.

   ^12The sixth emptied his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its
   waters dried up to make the way ready for the kings from the east.

   ^13Then I saw three foul spirits like frogs emerge from the mouth of
   the dragon and from the mouth of the animal and from the mouth of the
   false prophet.

   ^14They are demon spirits that perform wonders, and they go out to the
   kings all over the world to muster them for battle on the great Day of
   God Almighty.

   ^15(See, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who keeps awake, and
   keeps hold of his clothes, so that he will not have to go naked and be
   put to shame!)

   ^16So they mustered the kings at the place called in Hebrew Armageddon.

   ^17The seventh emptied his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out
   of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is all over!"

   ^18Then there were flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of
   thunder, and there was a great earthquake; there has never been such an
   earthquake since man first existed upon the earth, it was so great.

   ^19The great city broke into three pieces, the cities of the heathen
   fell, and God remembered to give mighty Babylon the cup of the wine of
   his fierce anger.

   ^20Every island vanished, the mountains disappeared,

   ^21huge hailstones of immense weight fell on mankind from heaven, and
   men reviled God because of the plague of hail, the plague of it was so
   terrible.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 17

   ^1Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls came and spoke to
   me.

   "Come," he said, "I will show you the doom of the great idolatress who
   is seated on many waters,

   ^2in whose idolatry the kings of the earth have joined, and with the
   wine of whose idolatry the inhabitants of the earth have been
   intoxicated."

   ^3So he carried me away in a trance to a desert, and I saw a woman
   seated on a scarlet animal all covered with blasphemous titles; it had
   seven heads and ten horns.

   ^4The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and glittered with gold,
   precious stones, and pearls. She had in her hand a gold cup full of
   accursed things, and the impurities of her immorality.

   ^5On her forehead there was written a name that was symbolic: "Mighty
   Babylon, mother of idolatresses and of earth's abominations."

   ^6I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God's people, and
   the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her I was perfectly
   amazed,

   ^7but the angel said to me,

   "Why are you amazed? I will explain to you what the woman and the
   animal with seven heads and ten horns that carries her symbolize.

   ^8The animal that you saw was, and is no more; it is going to come up
   out of the abyss, but it is to go to destruction. The inhabitants of
   the earth, whose names from the foundation of the world have not been
   written in the book of life, will be amazed when they see that the
   animal was, and is no more, and yet is to come.

   ^9Here is a problem for a profound mind! The seven heads are seven
   hills, on which the woman is seated.

   ^10They are also seven kings; five have fallen, one is reigning, the
   other has not yet come, and when he does his stay must be brief.

   ^11So must it be with the animal that was, and is no more. It is also
   an eighth king, although it is one of the seven, and it is to go to
   destruction.

   ^12The ten horns that you saw are also ten kings, who have not yet
   begun to reign, but for a single hour they receive authority as kings
   along with the animal.

   ^13They have one purpose, they give their power and authority to the
   animal.

   ^14They will make war upon the Lamb, and the Lamb with his elect,
   chosen, and faithful followers with him will conquer them, for he is
   Lord of lords and King of kings.

   ^15"The waters that you saw," he said to me, "on which the idolatrous
   woman was seated, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.

   ^16The ten horns that you saw and the animal will hate the idolatrous
   woman and make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh and burn her
   up with fire.

   ^17For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by
   having a common purpose and giving up their authority to the animal
   until God's decrees are carried out.

   ^18And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over
   the kings of the earth."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 18

   ^1Afterward I saw another angel come down from heaven. He possessed
   great authority and his splendor lighted up the earth.

   ^2He cried out with a mighty voice,

   "She is fallen! Mighty Babylon is fallen! She has become the haunt of
   demons, and a dungeon for every foul spirit and every unclean and
   loathsome bird,

   ^3for after drinking the wine of the passion of her immorality all the
   heathen have fallen; the kings of the earth have joined in her
   idolatry, and the traders of the earth have grown rich from her
   excessive luxury!"

   ^4Then I heard another voice from heaven say,

   "Come out of her, my people, so that you may not share in her sins, and
   suffer from her plagues.

   ^5For her sins are piled up to the sky, and God has remembered her
   crimes.

   ^6Pay her back in her own coin, and give her double for what she has
   done. In the cup she mixed for others, mix her a double draught.

   ^7The more she has given herself to pride and luxury the more you must
   give her torture and grief. Because she says to herself, I sit on a
   throne; I am not a widow, I shall never have any sorrow,'

   ^8her plagues will overtake her in one day, death, grief, and famine,
   and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who has judged
   her is mighty.

   ^9The kings of the earth who have joined in her idolatry and luxury
   will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke from her burning.

   ^10They will stand a long way off for fear of her torture and say,
   Alas! Alas for the great city, for Babylon the mighty city, for in a
   single hour your judgment has overtaken you!'

   ^11The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one
   will buy their cargoes any more--

   ^12cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen,
   purple, silk, and scarlet, all kinds of citron wood, all kinds of
   objects of ivory and costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble,

   ^13and cinnamon, spices, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive
   oil, flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, slaves--and human
   lives!

   ^14The fruit of your soul's desire is gone, your luxury and splendor
   have perished, and people will never find them again.

   ^15The dealers in these things, who had grown rich from their trade
   with her, for fear of her torture will stand a long way off, weeping
   and mourning,

   ^16and say, Alas! Alas for the great city that was dressed in fine
   linen, purple, and scarlet, and glittered with gold, precious stones,
   and pearls,

   ^17for in a single hour this vast wealth has been destroyed!' All
   navigators and all who travel by sea, sailors and sea-faring men, stood
   a long way off

   ^18and cried out when they saw the smoke from her burning, What city
   was like the great city?'

   ^19They threw dust on their heads and wept and mourned, crying out,
   Alas! Alas for the great city, where all who had ships on the sea grew
   rich through her extravagance! For in a single hour she has been
   destroyed!'

   ^20Gloat over her, heaven! and all you people of God, apostles, and
   prophets, for God has avenged you upon her!"

   ^21Then a mighty angel caught up a stone like a great millstone and
   threw it into the sea, saying,

   "With such violence will Babylon the great city be hurled to
   destruction and never be seen again!

   ^22The sound of harpists and musicians, flute-players, and trumpets
   will never be heard in you again. No craftsman of any kind will ever be
   found in you again, no sound of the millstone will ever be heard in you
   again;

   ^23no light of any lamp will ever shine in you again; no voice of bride
   or bridegroom will ever be heard in you again. For your merchants were
   the great men of the earth; by your magic all the heathen have been led
   astray,

   ^24and in you was found the blood of prophets, God's people, and all
   who have been slaughtered on the earth."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chapter 19

   ^1After that I heard what sounded like the loud shout of a great
   multitude in heaven saying,

   "Praise the Lord! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,

   ^2for his judgments are sound and upright. For he has passed judgment
   upon the great idolatress who corrupted the earth with her idolatry,
   and he has avenged the blood of his slaves upon her!"

   ^3Then they said again,

   "Praise the Lord! For smoke will go up from her forever and ever!"

   ^4Then the twenty-four elders and the four animals fell down and
   worshiped God who was seated upon the throne.

   "Amen!" they said, "Praise the Lord!"

   ^5And there came a voice from the throne, saying,

   "Praise our God, all you slaves of his, high and low, who fear him!"

   ^6Then I heard what sounded like the shout of a great multitude and the
   noise of many waters and the sound of mighty thunders, saying,

   "Praise the Lord; for the Lord our God, the Almighty now reigns!

   ^7Let us be glad and triumphant and give him glory, for the marriage of
   the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.

   ^8She has been permitted to wear clean, glistening linen, for linen
   represents the upright deeds of God's people."

   ^9Then he said to me,

   "Write: Blessed are they who are invited to the marriage supper of the
   Lamb.' These," he said to me, "are the true words of God."

   ^10I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me,

   "You must not do that. I am only a fellow-slave of yours and of your
   brothers who have accepted the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the
   testimony of Jesus is what inspires prophecy."

   ^11Then I saw heaven thrown open and there appeared a white horse. His
   rider was called Faithful and True, and he judges and wages war in
   uprightness.

   ^12His eyes blazed like fire. There were many diadems on his head, and
   there was a name written on him which no one knew but himself.

   ^13The garment he wore was spattered with blood, and his name was the
   Word of God.

   ^14The armies of heaven followed him mounted on white horses and
   clothed in pure white linen.

   ^15From his mouth came a sharp sword with which he is to strike down
   the heathen. He will shepherd them with a staff of iron, and will tread
   the winepress of the fierce anger of God Almighty.

   ^16On his clothing and his thigh he has this title written: King of
   kings and Lord of lords.

   ^17Then I saw an angel standing on the sun, and shouting in a loud
   voice to all the birds that fly in midair,

   "Come! Gather for God's great banquet,

   ^18and eat the bodies of kings, commanders, and mighty men, of horses
   and their riders--the bodies of all men, slaves and freemen, high and
   low."

   ^19Then I saw the animal and the kings of the earth and their armies
   gather to make war on him who was mounted upon the horse and upon his
   army.

   ^20And the animal was captured and with it the false prophet who
   performed wonders on its behalf by means of which he led astray those
   who had let the animal's mark be put on them and who worshiped its
   statue. Both of them were flung alive into the fiery lake of burning
   brimstone.

   ^21The rest were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of
   him who sat on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves upon
   their bodies.

  Chapter 20

   ^1Then I saw an angel come down from heaven with the key of the abyss
   and a great chain in his hand.

   ^2He seized the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil and
   Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,

   ^3and hurled him into the abyss and he closed it and sealed it over
   him, to keep him from leading the heathen astray any longer, until the
   thousand years are over; after that he has to be released for a little
   while.

   ^4Then I saw thrones with beings seated on them, who were empowered to
   act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded on
   account of the testimony of Jesus and the message of God, who refused
   to worship the animal and its statue, and would not have its mark put
   on their foreheads or on their hands. They were restored to life and
   reigned with the Christ a thousand years.

   ^5The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand
   years were over. This is the first resurrection.

   ^6Blessed and holy is the man who experiences the first resurrection!
   The second death has no power over them; they will be priests of God
   and the Christ, and reign with him for the thousand years.

   ^7When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his
   prison,

   ^8and will go out to lead astray the heathen in the four corners of the
   earth, Gog and Magog, and to muster them for battle, in numbers like
   the sand of the seashore.

   ^9They came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the
   encampment of God's people, and the beloved city. Then fire came down
   from heaven and consumed them,

   ^10and the devil who led them astray was flung into the fiery,
   sulphurous lake, where the animal and the false prophet were, there to
   be tortured day and night forever and ever.

   ^11Then I saw a great white throne with a being seated on it from whose
   presence earth and sky fled so far that they could not be found.

   ^12I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne, and books
   were opened. Then another book was opened; it was the book of life. And
   the dead were judged by what was written in the books about what they
   had done.

   ^13The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and the
   underworld gave up the dead that were in them, and they were all judged
   by what they had done.

   ^14Then death and Hades were flung into the fiery lake. This is the
   second death--the fiery lake.

   ^15Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was
   flung into the fiery lake.

  Chapter 21

   ^1Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
   first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.

   ^2And I saw the new Jerusalem, the holy city, come down out of heaven
   from God, like a bride dressed and ready to meet her husband.

   ^3I heard a loud voice from the throne say,

   "See! God's dwelling is with men, and he will live with them. They will
   be his people and God himself will be with them,

   ^4and he will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no death
   any longer, nor any grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed
   away."

   ^5Then he who sat upon the throne said,

   "See! I am making everything new! Write this," he said, "for these
   words are trustworthy and true.

   ^6It is all over!" he told me, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
   beginning and the end I will give anyone who is thirsty water without
   cost from the spring of the water of life.

   ^7He who is victorious will possess all this, and I will be his God and
   he will be my son.

   ^8But the cowardly, unfaithful, and polluted--murderers, immoral
   people, those who practice magic or idolatry, and all liars will find
   themselves in the burning lake of fire and brimstone. This is the
   second death."

   ^9Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the
   seven last plagues came and spoke to me.

   "Come," he said, "I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."

   ^10He carried me away in a trance to a great, high mountain, and showed
   me Jerusalem, the holy city, coming down out of heaven from God,

   ^11in all the glory of God. It shone with a radiance like that of some
   very precious stone, like jasper, clear as crystal.

   ^12It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at
   the gates, which had carved upon them the names of the twelve tribes of
   the children of Israel.

   ^13There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three
   gates on the south, and three gates on the west.

   ^14The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were
   the twelve names of the Lamb's twelve apostles.

   ^15The angel who talked with me had a gold measuring rod, with which to
   measure the city and its gates and wall.

   ^16The city was a square, its length the same as its breadth. He
   measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000 furlongs. Its length,
   breadth, and height were the same.

   ^17He measured the wall and it was about 144 cubits (216 feet), as men
   measure, for that was the way the angel measured.

   ^18The material of the wall was jasper, but the city was pure gold, as
   transparent as glass.

   ^19The foundation stones of the wall of the city were ornamented with
   all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation stone was jasper,
   the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,

   ^20the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the
   eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh
   jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.

   ^21The twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate made of a single
   pearl. The principal street of the city was pure gold, as transparent
   as glass.

   ^22I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are
   its temple.

   ^23The city does not need the sun nor the moon to shine in it, for the
   glory of God lighted it, and the Lamb is its lamp.

   ^24The heathen will walk by its light. The kings of the earth will
   bring their splendor to it.

   ^25Its gates will never be shut by day--for there will be no night
   there

   ^26and they will bring the splendor and the wealth of the heathen into
   it.

   ^27Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who indulges in
   abominable practices and falsehoods, but only those who are written in
   the Lamb's book of life.

  Chapter 22

   ^1Then he showed me a river of living water, clear as crystal, which
   issued from the throne of God and of the Lamb,

   ^2and ran through the middle of the principal street of the city. On
   both sides of the river grew the tree of life. It bore twelve kinds of
   fruit, yielding a different kind each month, and its leaves were a cure
   for the heathen.

   ^3There will no longer be anything that is accursed. The throne of God
   and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his slaves will worship him;

   ^4they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.

   ^5There will no longer be any night and they will have no need of
   lamplight or sunlight, for the Lord God will shine on them, and they
   will reign forever and ever.

   ^6"These words are trustworthy and true," he said to me; "For the Lord,
   the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his
   slaves what must happen very soon.

   ^7See! I am coming very soon! Blessed is he who heeds the words of
   prophecy that are in this book."

   ^8It was I, John, who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw
   them, I fell at the feet of the angel who showed them to me, to worship
   him.

   ^9But he said to me,

   "You must not do that. I am only a fellow-slave of yours and of your
   brothers the prophets and the men who heed the words of this book.
   Worship God!

   ^10"Do not seal up the words of prophecy that are in this book," he
   said to me, "for the time of their fulfilment is very near.

   ^11Let the evil-doer do worse and worse, let the base grow baser and
   baser, let the upright man be more and more upright, and the man who is
   holy be more and more holy."

   ^12"See! I am coming very soon, bringing with me my rewards, to repay
   everyone for what he has done.

   ^13I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning
   and the end.

   ^14Blessed are those who wash their robes, so as to have the right to
   approach the tree of life and to enter the gates of the city.

   ^15The dogs, those who practice magic or immorality, murderers,
   idolaters, and anyone who loves falsehood or tells lies will be shut
   out of it.

   ^16"I, Jesus, sent my angel to give you this testimony for the
   churches. I am of the line and family of David, I am the bright morning
   star."

   ^17"Come," say the Spirit and the bride. Let everyone who hears this
   say,

   "Come!"

   Let everyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who wants it come and take
   without cost living water.

   ^18I warn everyone who hears the message of prophecy in this book read,
   that if anyone adds anything to it, God will inflict upon him the
   plagues that are described in this book;

   ^19and if anyone removes from this book any of the prophetic messages
   it contains, God will remove from him his share in the tree of life and
   the holy city which are described in this book.

   ^20He who testifies to all this says,

   "It is true! I am coming very soon!" Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!

   ^21The blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ be with his people.
